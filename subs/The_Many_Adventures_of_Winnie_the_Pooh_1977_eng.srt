00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,093
This could be the
room of any small boy,

3
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:39,139
but it just happens to belong
to a boy named Christopher Robin.

4
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,766
Like most small boys,

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,353
Christopher Robin
has toy animals to play with.

6
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:48,857
They all live together
in a wonderful world of make-believe.

7
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:54,029
His best friend is a bear
called Winnie the Pooh,

8
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,490
or "Pooh" for short.

9
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,370
Pooh had some unusual adventures,
right here in the Hundred Acre Wood.

10
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,836
Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood

11
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,216
Where Christopher Robin plays

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:20,264
You'll find
the enchanted neighbourhood

13
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:25,602
Of Christopher's childhood days

14
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,023
A donkey named Eeyore is his friend

15
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,570
And Kanga and little Roo

16
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,948
There's Rabbit and Piglet

17
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,659
And there's Owl

18
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,873
But most of all Winnie the Pooh

19
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,376
Winnie the Pooh

20
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,713
Tubby little cubby
all stuffed with fluff

21
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,550
He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh

22
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,053
Willy nilly, silly old bear

23
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,098
Winnie the Pooh

24
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,934
Tubby little cubby
all stuffed with fluff

25
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,396
He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,151
Willy nilly silly old bear

27
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,323
Winnie the Pooh lived
in this enchanted forest,

28
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,408
under the name of Sanders,

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,912
which means he had the name
over the door in gold letters

30
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,998
and he lived under it.

31
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,085
Now, when Pooh heard
his Pooh-coo clock...

32
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,927
He knew it was time for something.

33
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,846
But he was a bear of very little brain.

34
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,598
So when he thought,

35
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,643
he thought in the most
thoughtful way he could think.

36
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,895
I haven't thought of anything, have you?

37
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,524
Nor neither have I.

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,861
Think... Think... Think...

39
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,076
Oh, yes, time for my stoutness exercise.

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,787
Up, down, up.

41
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,207
When I up, down, touch the ground

42
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,668
It puts me in the mood

43
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,295
Up, down, touch the ground

44
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,424
In the mood for food

45
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,387
I am stout, round and I have found

46
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,847
Speaking poundage-wise

47
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,477
I improve my appetite when I exercise

48
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,563
Oh, stuff and fluff.

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,111
That's better, thank you.

50
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,196
Now, where was I?

51
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,413
Oh, yes. I'm rumbly in my tumbly.

52
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,206
Time for something sweet.

53
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,043
I am short, fat and proud of that

54
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,546
So with all my might

55
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:02,384
I up, down, up, down
to my appetite's delight

56
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,637
While I up, down, touch the ground

57
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,348
I think of things to chew

58
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,143
Like honey and milk and chocolate.

59
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,562
With a hefty happy appetite

60
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,064
I'm a hefty, happy Pooh

61
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,319
With a hefty, happy appetite
he's a hefty, happy Pooh

62
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,574
Oh, bother. Empty again.

63
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,702
Only the sticky part is left.

64
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,421
That buzzing noise means something.

65
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:45,927
The only reason for making
a buzzing noise that I know of

66
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,473
is because you're a bee!

67
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:59,483
The only reason for being a bee
is to make honey.

68
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,780
The only reason for making honey
is so I can eat it.

69
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,620
So Winnie the Pooh
climbed the honey tree.

70
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,581
He climbed and he climbed
and he climbed.

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,793
As he climbed, he hummed a little hum.

72
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,838
I call it my Rumbly in my Tumbly song.

73
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,299
Yes, it went something like this.

74
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,639
I am so rumbly in my tumbly

75
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,560
Time to munch an early luncheon

76
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,650
Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree

77
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,319
If a Pooh flew like a bee

78
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,656
But I wouldn't be a bear then

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,659
So I guess I wouldn't care then

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,413
Bears love honey and I'm a Pooh bear

81
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,705
So I do care

82
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,374
So I climb there

83
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,585
I'm so rumbly in my tumbly

84
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,754
Time for something...

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,339
For something

86
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,715
sweet

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,843
to eat!

88
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,470
If only I hadn't...

89
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,848
You see, what I meant to do...

90
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,183
And it all comes, I suppose,

91
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,060
from liking honey so much.

92
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,065
Oh, bother.

93
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,111
Winnie the Pooh
crawled out of the gorse bush,

94
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,613
brushed the prickles from his nose,

95
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,450
- and began to think.
- Think... Think... Think...

96
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,535
The first person he thought of was...

97
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,370
- Winnie the Pooh?
- No.

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,913
Christopher Robin.

99
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,002
Christopher Robin lived in
another part of the forest

100
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,214
where he could be near his friends,
and help them with their problems.

101
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,510
On this summer day,
gloomy old Eeyore,

102
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,890
being stuffed with sawdust,
had lost his tail again.

103
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,727
- Eeyore, this won't hurt.
- Never does.

104
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,067
There now. Did I get your tail
back on properly, Eeyore?

105
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,238
No matter.
Most likely lose it again, anyway.

106
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,242
It is my considered opinion

107
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,580
that Eeyore's tail should
be placed a trifle to the right.

108
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,707
Now, if you were to ask me,

109
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,210
I think it's just a wee bit...

110
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,003
South.

111
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,589
No, no. North, dear.

112
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,926
Cheer up, Eeyore.

113
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,595
Don't be so gloomy. Try swishing it.

114
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,186
- It worked. It worked.
- Oh, goody!

115
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,730
Thanks.

116
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,109
It's not much of a tail,
but I'm sort of attached to it.

117
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,279
Good morning, Christopher Robin.

118
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,740
Oh, good morning, Winnie the Pooh.

119
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,201
- Good morning, Pooh bear.
- Good morning, Pooh bear.

120
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,870
If it is a good morning, which I doubt.

121
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,959
What are you looking for, Pooh bear?

122
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,963
I just said to myself, coming along,
thinking and wondering,

123
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,799
if you had such a thing as a...

124
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,886
Such a thing, Christopher,
as a balloon, about you.

125
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,641
What do you want a balloon for?

126
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,979
Honey.

127
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,731
But you don't get honey with a balloon.

128
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,484
- I do.
- How?

129
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,987
I shall fly like a bee

130
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,239
up to the honey tree. See?

131
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,157
But just a minute.

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,493
You can't fool the bees that way.

133
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,579
You'll see!

134
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,497
Now, would you be so kind

135
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,875
as to tow me to a muddy place
of which I know of.

136
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,421
So Christopher Robin
towed Winnie the Pooh

137
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,047
to the very muddy place.

138
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,430
Pooh rolled and rolled
until he was black all over.

139
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,394
There, now.

140
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,024
Isn't this a clever disguise?

141
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,692
What are you supposed to be?

142
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,655
I'm a little, black rain cloud, of course.

143
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,658
Silly old bear.

144
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,329
Now, would you aim me
at the bees, please?

145
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,374
Careful, Pooh. Hold on tight.

146
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,376
Yes.

147
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,544
- Four...
- Yes.

148
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,712
...three...
- Yes.

149
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,838
...two...
- Yes.

150
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,048
...one!

151
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,261
I'm just a little black rain cloud

152
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,931
Hovering under the honey tree

153
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,102
I'm only a little black rain cloud

154
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,272
Pay no attention to little me

155
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,027
Everyone knows that a rain cloud

156
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,322
Never eats honey
No, not a nip

157
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,325
I'm just floating around

158
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,243
Over the ground

159
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,330
Wondering where I will drip

160
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,920
Christopher Robin,

161
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:17,342
I think the bees
S-U-S-P-E-C-T something.

162
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,803
Perhaps they think
you're after their honey.

163
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,306
Well, it may be that.
You never can tell with bees.

164
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,936
Oh, I'm just a little black rain cloud

165
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,523
Hovering under the honey tree

166
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,769
Christopher Robin!

167
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,356
I think it would help with this deception,

168
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,942
if you would kinda open
your umbrella and say...

169
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,614
- "It looks like rain."
- It looks like rain.

170
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,491
It looks like rain.

171
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,009
Christopher Robin, I have come
to a very important decision.

172
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,845
These are the wrong sorts of bees!

173
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,281
Excuse me, please, bees.

174
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,040
Christopher Robin!

175
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,876
Oh, bother!

176
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,379
I think I shall come down.

177
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,508
I'll catch you, Pooh.

178
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,765
Hurry, come on. The bees!

179
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,101
Help!

180
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,228
Christopher!

181
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,404
Christopher Robin,
you never can tell with bees.

182
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,204
Now, Pooh was not
the sort to give up easily.

183
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,250
When he put his mind to honey,
he stuck to it.

184
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,294
Now, honey rhymes with bunny,

185
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,630
and bunny rhymes with...

186
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,131
Rabbit?

187
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,345
I like Rabbit because
he uses short, easy words,

188
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,930
like, "How about lunch?"

189
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,933
And, "Help yourself, Pooh."

190
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,643
Pooh? Lunch?

191
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,103
Oh, no. Not again.

192
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,063
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness gracious!

193
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,774
Is anybody at home?

194
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,988
What I said was, "Is anybody at home?"

195
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,698
No!

196
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,201
Bother! Isn't there anybody here at all?

197
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,703
Nobody.

198
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:37,083
Must be somebody there, because
somebody must have said, "Nobody."

199
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,086
- Rabbit, isn't that you?
- No!

200
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,963
Isn't that the Rabbit's voice?

201
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,259
I don't think so. It isn't meant to be.

202
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,971
- Hello, Rabbit!
- Oh, hello, Pooh bear.

203
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,639
Pooh bear!

204
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,477
What a pleasant surprise.

205
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,730
How about lunch?

206
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,982
Oh, thank you, Rabbit.

207
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,234
And help yourself, Pooh.

208
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,701
Would you like condensed milk
or honey on your bread?

209
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,579
Both! But never mind the bread, please.

210
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,873
Just a small helping, if you please.

211
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,208
There you are.

212
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,215
Is something wrong?

213
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,636
Well, I did mean
a little larger small helping.

214
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,805
Perhaps it would save time
if you took the whole jar?

215
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,265
Thank you, Rabbit.

216
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,356
So Pooh ate, and ate, and ate, and ate,

217
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,984
and ate, and ate and ate,
and ate and ate!

218
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,279
Until at last, he said to Rabbit,

219
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,949
in a rather sticky voice...

220
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,076
I must be going now.

221
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,661
Goodbye, Rabbit.

222
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,539
Well, goodbye,
if you're sure you won't have any more.

223
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,500
Is there any more?

224
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,004
- No, there isn't.
- I thought not.

225
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,555
Oh, help and bother! I'm stuck.

226
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,891
Oh, dear! Oh, gracious!

227
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,812
Well, it all comes from eating too much.

228
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,609
It all comes from not having
front doors big enough!

229
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,697
Oh, dear, it's no use.

230
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,408
Only one thing to do.
I'll get Christopher Robin.

231
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,785
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

232
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,413
Oh, my heavens to Betsy.

233
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,093
- Well, if it isn't Pooh bear.
- Oh, hello, Owl.

234
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,805
Splendid day to be up
and about one's business, quite.

235
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,689
I say, are you stuck?

236
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,900
No, no, just resting,

237
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,987
and thinking and humming to myself.

238
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,616
You, sir, are stuck,

239
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,869
a wedged bear, in a great tightness.

240
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,538
In a word, irremovable.

241
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,625
Now, obviously,
this situation calls for an expert.

242
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,881
Somebody call for
an excavation expert?

243
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,508
I'm not in the book,
but I'm at your service.

244
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,678
Gopher's the name. Here's my card.
What's your problem?

245
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,805
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

246
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,435
It seems the entrance to
Rabbit's domicile is impassable.

247
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,021
To be exact, plugged.

248
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,733
- And you want me to dig it out?
- Precisely.

249
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,404
I say, it's over here, my good fellow.

250
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,827
First thing to be done
is get rid of that bear.

251
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,746
He's gumming up the whole project.

252
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,041
Dash-it-all, he is the project!

253
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,044
Hard digging, might hit bedrock.

254
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,797
Danger of cave-in. Risky.

255
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,383
Needs planks for bracing.

256
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,427
Big job. Take two, three days.

257
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,555
Three days? What about lunches?

258
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,682
No problem,
I always go home for lunch.

259
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,392
Oh, this will run into money.

260
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,562
I say, how much?

261
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,523
Do the job for hourly rate,

262
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:33,402
plus cover materials,
plus overtime, plus 10%.

263
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,737
And your estimate?

264
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,615
Nope, can't give an estimate. Too risky.

265
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,076
Blast-it-all.

266
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,954
Good idea! We'll dynamite, save time.

267
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,455
What's the charge?

268
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,291
The charge?
Oh, about seven sticks of dynamite.

269
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,086
No, no, no, the cost!
The charge in money?

270
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,214
Nope, no charge account.
I work strictly cash.

271
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,591
Obviously, but I should think...

272
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,053
I can't stand around lollygagging
all day. Got a tight schedule.

273
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,182
If you think it over, let me know.

274
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,226
You got my card. I'm not in the book.

275
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,729
Dash-it-all, he's gone.

276
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,149
After all, he's not in the book, you know.

277
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,110
Here we come. Don't worry.

278
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,697
Cheer up, Pooh bear. We're coming.

279
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,907
We'll get you out.

280
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,201
Well, maybe.

281
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,746
Silly old bear. Here, give me your paw.

282
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,254
It's no use. I'm stuck!

283
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,508
Well, if we can't pull you out, Pooh,
perhaps we can push you back.

284
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,344
Oh, no! Not that! Oh, my gracious!

285
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,929
Oh, dear!

286
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,101
Having got this far,
it seems a pity to waste it.

287
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,397
Pooh bear,
there's only one thing we can do.

288
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,107
Wait for you to get thin again.

289
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,444
Oh, bother. How long will that take?

290
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,740
Days. Weeks. Months. Who knows?

291
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,367
Oh, dear.

292
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,329
If I have to face

293
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,539
that thing for months,

294
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,583
I might as well make the best of it.

295
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,838
Oh, no! There it is again!

296
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,716
Well, I'll just turn it to the wall.

297
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,302
Oh, dear!

298
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,138
Yes, a frame.

299
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,395
No. No, no, no. No.

300
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,691
Very nice.

301
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,529
And a splash of colour.

302
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,326
It just doesn't have
that rustic, informal look.

303
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,996
There.

304
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,831
A hunting trophy.

305
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,876
I know just the thing.

306
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,046
Something tickles.

307
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,052
Oh, Pooh! You messed up my moose!

308
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,097
Pooh?

309
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,266
Roo has a little surprise for you.

310
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,686
- Flowers.
- Honeysuckle.

311
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,398
No, Pooh, you don't eat them.

312
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,233
You smell them.

313
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,407
That's not bad. Not bad at all.
It's rather good, I think.

314
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,368
Oh, no!

315
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,205
Oh, no! Help!

316
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,044
Why did I ever invite that bear to lunch?

317
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,088
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

318
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,385
While Pooh's bottom
was stuck at the top of page 28,

319
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,097
his top was stuck
at the bottom of page 30.

320
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,058
So both ends waited to get thin again.

321
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,060
Day after day.

322
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,564
Night after lonely night.

323
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,069
I wonder what's for breakfast?

324
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,866
Breakfast.

325
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,164
Lunch.

326
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,420
- A lunch box!
- It certainly is!

327
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,672
I'm working the swing shift, you know.

328
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,050
Time for my midnight snack.

329
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,595
Say! Ain't you that stuck-up bear?

330
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,473
I still think I could blast you out of there.

331
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:36,145
What sort of lunch is in that lunch box?

332
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,315
Well, let's see here.

333
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,401
Summer squash...

334
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,199
Salmon salad, succotash,

335
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,242
spiced custard,

336
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,286
and honey.

337
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,454
Honey?

338
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,873
Honey? Oh, no!

339
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,128
Could you spare a small smackerel?

340
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:06,008
Say, you ought to do something
about that speech impediment, sonny.

341
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,468
Thank you, Gopher.

342
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,803
Oh, no! Not that!

343
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,805
No, no, no, no, no!

344
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,014
Not one drop!

345
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,476
But, Rabbit, I wasn't going to eat it.

346
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,686
I was just going to taste it.

347
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,980
I'll taste it for you.

348
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:25,152
That supercilious scoundrel
confiscated my honey.

349
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,327
I'm going to skedaddle.
I'm not in the book.

350
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,331
And I'm ding danged glad of it!

351
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,795
And then, one morning,
when Rabbit was beginning to think

352
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,589
he might never be able
to use his front door again,

353
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,633
- it happened.
- He budged.

354
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,718
Hooray! Christopher Crabin.

355
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,303
No, Chrostofer Raban.

356
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,056
He bidged! He badged! He booged!

357
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,766
Today is the day!

358
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,393
Hooray for you

359
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,187
Hooray for me

360
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,189
Hooray, hooray

361
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,066
The Pooh will soon be free

362
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,031
Now the time has come for proving

363
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,200
What the diet did for Pooh

364
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,411
And since we pledged
he'd be unwedged

365
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,496
That's what we're going to do

366
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,874
He'll be pulled and he'll be tugged

367
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,876
And eventually unplugged

368
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,211
We'll have a tug-of-war

369
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,547
To open Rabbit's door

370
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:32,094
Think heave-age
Think ho-age

371
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,807
And out the Pooh will go-age

372
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,437
For mind over matter

373
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,733
Has made the Pooh un-fatter

374
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,324
Heave, ho

375
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,784
Heave, heave, heave, heave

376
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,579
Heave...

377
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,873
There he goes!

378
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,544
Suffering sassafras.
He's sailing clean out of the book!

379
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,796
Quick! Turn the page!

380
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,347
Stuck again.

381
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,933
Don't worry, Pooh. We'll get you out.

382
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,186
No hurry. Take your time.

383
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,400
Bears love honey
and I'm a Pooh bear

384
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,777
Yum, yum, yum, yum

385
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,450
Yum, yum, yum, yum
Time for something sweet

386
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,286
We come to the next chapter in which...

387
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,789
But I haven't finished yet.

388
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,124
But, Pooh, you're in the next chapter.

389
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,127
What happens to me?

390
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,505
Well, let's turn the page and find out.

391
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,926
Now, one fine day, the east wind

392
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,554
traded places with the west wind.

393
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,474
That stirred things up a bit
all through the Hundred Acre Wood.

394
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,731
On this blustery day,

395
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,484
Pooh decided to visit
his thoughtful spot.

396
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,196
Yes, and on the way
I made up a little hum.

397
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,699
It hums something like this.

398
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,831
Oh, the wind is lashing lustily

399
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,375
And the trees are thrashing thrustily

400
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,669
And the leaves are rustling gustily

401
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,046
So it's rather safe to say

402
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,924
That it seems
that it may turn out to be

403
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,679
It feels that it will undoubtedly

404
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,476
It looks like a rather
blustery day today

405
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,938
It seems that it may turn out to be

406
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,024
Feels that it will undoubtedly

407
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,153
Looks like a rather blustery day today

408
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,992
Fortunately, Pooh's thoughtful spot
was in a sheltered place.

409
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,413
He sat down and tried
hard to think of something.

410
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,540
Think, think, think, think, think.

411
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,963
Think... Think... Think...

412
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,467
Say, what's wrong, sonny?

413
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,346
- Got yourself a headache?
- No, I was just thinking.

414
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,514
Is that so? What about?

415
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,268
I... Oh, bother, you made me forget.

416
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,314
If I was you, I'd think about
skedaddling out of here.

417
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,482
Why?

418
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,817
Because it's Winds-day.

419
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,236
Winds-day?

420
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,492
I think I shall wish
everyone a happy Winds-day.

421
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,746
I shall begin with
my very dear friend, Piglet.

422
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,958
Piglet lived in the middle of the forest

423
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,504
in a very grand house,
in the middle of a beech tree.

424
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,423
Piglet loved it very much.

425
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,093
Yes.

426
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,764
You see, it's been
in the family a long time.

427
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,516
It belonged to my grandfather.

428
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,230
That's his name up there.
Trespassers Will.

429
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,816
That's short for Trespassers William.

430
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,859
Trespassers William?

431
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,153
Yes. And Grandma.

432
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,782
She called him T.W.

433
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,909
That's even shorter.

434
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,580
Yes, yes, yes. And on this blustery day,

435
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,669
- the wind was giving you a bother.
- Now, you've been here before.

436
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,922
I don't mind the leaves that are leaving.

437
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,966
It's the leaves that are coming!

438
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,886
Happy Winds-day, Piglet.

439
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,349
Well, it isn't very happy for me.

440
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,809
Where are you going, Piglet?

441
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,603
That's what I'm asking myself, where?

442
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,982
Pooh!

443
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,443
What do you think
you will answer yourself?

444
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,987
Oh, I'm unravelling!

445
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,703
Oh, that was a close one!

446
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,664
Hang on tight, Piglet.

447
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,125
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear!

448
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,673
Look, Mama, look! A kite!

449
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,510
Oh, my goodness, it's Piglet!

450
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,097
Happy Winds-day, Kanga.
Happy Winds-day, Roo.

451
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,516
Can I fly Piglet next, Pooh?

452
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,852
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear!

453
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,190
There, that should
stand against anything.

454
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,736
Oh, help, help! Somebody, save me!

455
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,742
- Happy Winds-day, Eeyore.
- Thanks for noticing me.

456
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,161
Oh, bother!

457
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,457
Oh, what a refreshing day
for harvesting.

458
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,501
Happy Winds-day, Rabbit.

459
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,420
Pooh bear! Stop! Oh, go back!

460
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,964
Oh, no! Oh, no!

461
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,424
Oh, no!

462
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,510
Oh, yes!

463
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,054
Next time, blow through
my rutabaga patch.

464
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,070
Who, who, who... Who is it?

465
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,448
It's me. Please, may I come in?

466
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,201
Well, I say now.

467
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,621
Someone has pasted
Piglet on my window.

468
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,791
Well, well! Pooh, too.

469
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,751
This is a surprise.

470
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,338
Do come in and make yourselves

471
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,424
comfortable.

472
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:52,182
Am I correct in assuming it is
a rather blustery day outside?

473
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,350
Yes, sir, Owl.

474
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,019
It's a very, very blustery day outside.

475
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,856
Oh, yes. That reminds me.

476
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,024
Happy Winds-day, Owl.

477
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,572
My good fellow, I wouldn't go so far
as to call it a Winds-day,

478
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,199
just a gentle spring zephyr.

479
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,784
Excuse me, Owl,

480
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,746
but is there honey in that pot?

481
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,707
Oh, yes, of course. Help yourself.

482
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,792
Now, as I was saying,

483
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:23,171
this is just a mild spring zephyr,
compared to the big wind of '67.

484
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,967
Or was it '76? Oh, well, no matter.

485
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,262
Oh, I remember the big blow well.

486
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,889
I'll remember this one, too.

487
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:36,143
It was the year my Aunt Clara
went to visit her cousin.

488
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,270
Now, her cousin was not only

489
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,648
gifted on the glockenspiel,
but being a screech owl,

490
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,401
also sang soprano in the London opera.

491
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,530
Thank you, Piglet.

492
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,117
You see, her constant practising
so unnerved my aunt,

493
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,078
that she laid a seagull egg by mistake.

494
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,675
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear.

495
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,183
Well, I say now, someone has...

496
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,061
Pooh, did you do that?

497
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,606
I don't think so.

498
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,860
As soon as Christopher Robin
heard of the disaster,

499
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,446
he hurried to the scene
of Owl's misfortune.

500
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,158
What a pity.

501
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,495
Owl, I don't think we will
ever be able to fix it.

502
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,123
If you ask me,
when a house looks like that,

503
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,167
it's time to find another one.

504
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,586
That's a very good idea, Eeyore.

505
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,881
Might take a day or two,
but I'll find a new one.

506
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,470
Good, that will just give me time
to tell you about my Uncle Clyde,

507
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,391
a very independent barn owl,
he didn't give a hoot for tradition.

508
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,685
He became enamoured of a pussycat,

509
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,229
and went to sea in
a beautiful pea green boat.

510
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:08,694
Owl talked from page 41 to page 62.

511
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:14,741
On page 62, the blustery day
turned into a blustery night.

512
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,578
To Pooh, it was a very
anxious sort of night,

513
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,165
filled with anxious sorts of noises.

514
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,004
One of the noises was a sound
that had never been heard before.

515
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,719
Is that you, Piglet?

516
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,768
Well, tell me about it tomorrow...
Eeyore?

517
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,357
Oh, come in, Christopher Robin.

518
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,864
Now, Pooh, being a bear
of very little brain,

519
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,616
decided to invite the new sound in.

520
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,084
Hello, out there.

521
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,211
Oh, I hope nobody answers.

522
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,132
Hello, I'm Tigger!

523
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,804
- You scared me.
- Sure I did.

524
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,639
Everyone's scared of tiggers.

525
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,142
- Who are you?
- I'm Pooh.

526
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,644
Oh, a Pooh, sure.

527
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,273
- What's a Pooh?
- You're sitting on one.

528
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,316
I am?

529
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,693
Oh, well, glad to meet ya.
Name's Tigger.

530
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,029
T, I, double "guh," err.

531
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,113
That spells "Tigger."

532
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,283
But what is a tigger?

533
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,328
Well, he asked for it.

534
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,332
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

535
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,335
Their tops are made out of rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

536
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,046
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

537
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,381
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

538
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,926
I'm the only one

539
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,638
Then what's that over there?

540
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,932
Oh, hey, hey, look, look, look.

541
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,018
Oh, what a strange looking creature.

542
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,272
Look at those beady little eyes,

543
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,191
and that pur-posti-rus chin,

544
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,694
and those ricky-diculus
striped pyjamas.

545
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,280
Looked like another tigger to me.

546
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,283
Oh, no, it's not! I'm the only tigger.

547
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,580
Watch me scare the stripes
off of this impostor.

548
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,046
Is he gone?

549
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,048
All except the tail.

550
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,091
He's gone.

551
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,469
You can come out now, Tigger.

552
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,638
Tigger?

553
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,560
- Hello, I'm Tigger.
- You said that.

554
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,354
Oh, well, did I say I was hungry?

555
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,149
- I don't think so.
- Well, then I'll say it.

556
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,483
I'm hungry!

557
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,694
Oh, not for honey, I hope.

558
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,946
Honey! Oh, boy, honey!

559
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,448
That's what tiggers like best.

560
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,075
I was afraid of that.

561
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,996
Oh, say...

562
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,082
Yuck!

563
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,501
Tiggers don't like honey!

564
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,087
But you said...

565
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,216
That icky, sticky stuff
is only fit for heffalumps and woozles.

566
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,260
You mean elephants and weasels.

567
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,637
That's what I said.
Heffalumps and woozles.

568
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:27,642
Well, what do heffa... Halla...
What do they do?

569
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,188
- Nothing much. Just steal honey.
- Steal honey?

570
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,482
They sure do. Well, I'd better
be bouncing along now, chum.

571
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,775
Cheerio!

572
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,613
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

573
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,490
Their tops are made out of rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

574
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,285
They're bouncy trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

575
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,121
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

576
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,290
I'm the only one

577
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,298
Well, if what Tigger said was true,

578
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,551
and there really were
heffalumps and woozles about,

579
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,637
there was only one thing to do.

580
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,308
Take drastic precautions
to protect his precious honey.

581
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,067
Oh, hello.

582
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,403
Am I glad to see you!

583
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,614
It's more friendly with two.

584
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:28,161
Now, you go that way,
and I'll go this way.

585
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,044
You didn't see anything, did you?

586
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,921
Neither did I.

587
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:45,011
Now, the very blustery night
turned into a very rainy night,

588
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,847
and Pooh kept his lonely vigil,

589
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,309
hour after hour after hour.

590
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,104
Until, at last,

591
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:58,525
Pooh fell fast asleep
and began to dream.

592
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,949
Heffalumps and woozles.

593
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,787
Heffalumps and woozles steal honey.

594
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,873
Beware. Beware.

595
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,710
They're black, they're brown
they're up, they're down

596
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,712
They're in, they're out
they're all about

597
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,797
They're far, they're near
they're gone, they're here

598
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,716
They're quick and slick
they're insincere

599
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,636
Beware, beware
Be a very wary bear

600
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,724
A heffalump or woozle
is very confusil

601
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,978
A heffalump or woozle's
very sly, sly, sly

602
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,771
They come in ones and twosles

603
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,732
But if they so choosles

604
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,276
Before your eyes
you'll see them multiply

605
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,944
Ply, ply, ply

606
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,614
They're extraordinary
So better be wary

607
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,117
Because they come
in every shape and size

608
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,785
Size, size, size

609
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,831
If honey's what you covet
You'll find that they love it

610
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,543
Because they guzzle up
the thing you prize

611
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,837
They're green, they're blue
they're pink, they're white

612
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,089
They're round, they're square
they're a terrible sight

613
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,926
They tie themselves in horrible knots
They come in stripes or polka dots

614
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,014
Beware, beware
Be a very wary bear

615
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,530
They're extraordinary
So better be wary

616
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,700
Because they come in
every shape and size

617
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,034
Size, size, size

618
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,038
If honey's what you covet
You'll find that they love it

619
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,208
Because they'll guzzle up
the things you prize

620
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,129
They're black, they're brown
they're up, they're down

621
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,089
They're in, they're out
they're all about

622
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,258
They're far, they're near
they're gone, they're here

623
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,302
They're quick and slick
they're insincere

624
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,972
Beware, beware
Beware, beware

625
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,392
Beware

626
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,986
Is it raining in there?

627
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,155
It's raining out here, too.

628
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,910
As a matter of fact, it was raining
all over the Hundred Acre Wood.

629
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,537
There was a thunderstorm on page 71.

630
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:45,877
And on page 73,
there was a bit of a cloudburst.

631
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,298
It rained and it rained and it rained.

632
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,884
The rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

633
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,011
In rushing rising rivulets

634
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,263
Till the river crept out of its bed

635
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,599
And crept right into Piglet's

636
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,434
Poor Piglet he was frightened

637
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,354
With quite a rightful fright

638
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,898
And so in desperation

639
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,275
A message he did write

640
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,825
He placed it in a bottle

641
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,037
And it floated out of sight

642
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,499
And the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

643
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,793
So Piglet started bailing

644
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:36,219
He was unaware atop his chair
while bailing he was sailing

645
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,721
And the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

646
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,807
And the flood rose up, up, upper

647
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,226
Pooh too was caught
and so he thought

648
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,311
I must rescue my supper

649
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:50,275
Ten honey pots he rescued
Enough to see him through

650
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,819
But as he sopped up his supper

651
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,030
The river sopped up Pooh

652
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,159
And the water twirled and tossed him

653
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,745
In a honey pot canoe

654
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,831
Rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

655
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,333
When the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

656
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,753
So the Hundred Acre Wood
got floodier and floodier.

657
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,841
But the water couldn't come up
to Christopher Robin's house,

658
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,510
so that's where
everyone was gathering.

659
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,179
It was a time of great excitement.

660
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,307
But in the midst of all the excitement,

661
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,686
Eeyore stubbornly stuck to his task
of house-hunting for Owl.

662
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,605
There's one.

663
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,191
Cosy cottage. Nice location.

664
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,485
A bit damp for Owl, though.

665
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,740
Meanwhile, little Roo made
an important discovery.

666
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,534
Look! I've rescued a bottle.

667
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,328
And it's got something in it, too.

668
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,873
It's a message, and it says...

669
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,546
Owl, you fly over to Piglet's house,

670
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,882
and tell him we'll make a rescue.

671
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,593
A rescue? Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.

672
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,597
So Owl flew out over the flood

673
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,558
and he soon spotted two
tiny objects below him.

674
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,728
One was little Piglet
caught in the whirlpool,

675
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,897
and the other was Pooh,

676
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,566
trying to get the last bit
of honey from the pot.

677
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:20,490
Oh, Owl, I don't mean to complain,
but I'm afraid. I'm scared.

678
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,493
Now, now, Piglet, chin up
and all that sort of thing.

679
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,244
A rescue is being thought of.

680
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,622
Be brave, little Piglet.

681
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,584
It's awfully hard to be brave
when you're such a small animal.

682
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,880
To divert your small mind from
your unfortunate predicament,

683
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,133
I shall tell you an amusing anecdote.

684
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,846
It concerns a cousin of mine,

685
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,432
who became so frightened
during a flood that he...

686
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,601
I beg your pardon, Owl, but I think

687
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,438
we're coming to a flutterfall,
a flatterfall, a very big waterfall.

688
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,732
Please, no interruptions.

689
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,670
There you are, Pooh bear.

690
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,547
Now, to continue my story...

691
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,300
Look, there's Pooh. Over here, Pooh!

692
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,302
Oh, hello, Christopher Robin.

693
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,305
Pooh, thank goodness you're safe.

694
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:30,143
- Have you seen Piglet?
- Excuse me, I have...

695
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,646
What I mean is, here I am!

696
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,525
- Pooh, you rescued Piglet.
- I did?

697
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,737
Yes, and it was a very brave thing to do.

698
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,238
It was?

699
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,991
- You are a hero.
- I am?

700
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,328
As soon as the flood is over,
I shall give you a hero party.

701
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,003
Attention, everybody.

702
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,630
Now, this party is a hero party,

703
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:04,343
because of what someone did.
And that someone is...

704
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,015
- I found it.
- Found what, Eeyore?

705
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,933
House for Owl.

706
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,604
I say, Eeyore, good show!

707
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,857
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Where is it, Eeyore?

708
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,527
If you want to follow me,
I'll show it to ya.

709
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,364
Everyone followed Eeyore.

710
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,660
Then, to the surprise of all,
Eeyore stopped right in front of...

711
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,205
Piglet's house?

712
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,665
Why are you stopping here, Eeyore?

713
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,169
This is it, Owl's new house.

714
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,379
Oh, dear, mercy me!

715
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,216
Oh, dear, mercy me, too!

716
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,718
Name's on it and everything.

717
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,056
W-O-L. That spells "Owl."

718
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,267
Bless my soul, so it does.

719
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,770
Well, what do you think of it?

720
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,733
It is a nice house, Eeyore, but...

721
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:05,071
It is a lovely house, Eeyore, but...

722
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:10,076
It's the best house in the whole world.

723
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,495
Tell them it's your house, Piglet.

724
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,996
No, Pooh.

725
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:19,460
This house belongs
to our very good friend,

726
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,004
Owl.

727
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,757
But, Piglet, where will you live?

728
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,177
Well, I guess I shall live...

729
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,264
I suppose I shall live...

730
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,308
With me! You shall live with me.

731
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,019
- Won't you, Piglet?
- With you?

732
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,022
Oh, thank you, Pooh bear.

733
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,859
Of course I will.

734
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,779
Piglet, that was
a very grand thing to do.

735
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,282
A heroic thing to do.

736
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:54,453
Christopher Robin,
can you make a one-hero party

737
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,290
into a two-hero party?

738
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:01,127
Of course we can, silly old bear.

739
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,964
And so, Pooh was
a hero for saving Piglet,

740
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:09,135
and Piglet was a hero for giving Owl
his grand home in the beech tree.

741
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,472
We never will forget
our hero of the wet

742
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,476
Our quick thinking
unsinking Pooh bear

743
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,647
And Piglet, who indeed
helped out a friend in need

744
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,150
For truly they're
the heroes of the day

745
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:29,614
So we say hip-hip-hooray
for the Piglet and the Pooh

746
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,282
Piglet and Pooh we salute you

747
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:35,077
What's all that stomping
and singing and silly shenanigans?

748
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,500
Hip-hip hoo-ray
Hip-hip hoo-ray

749
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,963
Hip-hip hoo-ray for Winnie the Pooh

750
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,175
And Piglet, too!

751
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,095
I sure like bouncing.
Wasn't that fun, Piglet?

752
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:58,434
Yes, Pooh, but the best part
is when it stops.

753
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,064
In the next chapter,
there's a great deal of bouncing.

754
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,774
There is?

755
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,613
I think that I just remembered
something that I forgot to do yesterday

756
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,407
and shan't be able to do tomorrow.

757
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,036
So I suppose I really ought to
go back and do it now.

758
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,873
- Goodbye, Pooh.
- Goodbye, Piglet.

759
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,918
Now, is the next chapter all about me?

760
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,879
No, no. It's mostly about Tigger.

761
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,006
Oh, bother!

762
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,634
- But you're in it.
- Oh, good!

763
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,386
What will I be doing?

764
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:38,265
Well, Pooh, you'll be sitting
in your thoughtful spot,

765
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,059
thinking, as usual.

766
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,562
Think, think. Think, think, think.
Think. Think.

767
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,357
While he was thinking,
all of a sudden...

768
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,150
Hello, Pooh!

769
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,152
I'm Tigger!

770
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,321
T, I, double "guh," err.

771
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,741
- That spells "Tigger."
- I know.

772
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,578
- You've bounced me before.
- I did?

773
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,750
Oh, yeah! I re-cog-go-nise you.
You're the one stuffed with fluff.

774
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,003
Yeah. And you're sitting on it.

775
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,255
Yeah! And it's comfy, too.

776
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,590
Well, I gotta go now.

777
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,676
I got a lot of bouncing to do.

778
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,761
T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now.

779
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:22,893
There goes Tigger, bouncing in on
his friends when they least expect him.

780
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,189
Oh, hello, Piglet! I'm Tigger.

781
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,608
Oh, Tigger. You scared me.

782
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,986
Oh, shucks.

783
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,946
That was just one of my little bounces.

784
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,158
It was? Oh, thank you, Tigger.

785
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:41,662
Yeah. I'm saving my best bounce
for old long-ears!

786
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,465
There! That should do it.

787
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,968
Oh, no! Stop!

788
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,055
Hello, Rabbit. I'm Tigger.

789
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,723
T, I, double "guh"...

790
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,433
Please! Don't spell it.

791
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,019
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

792
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,230
Just... Just look at my beautiful garden.

793
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,983
Messy, isn't it?

794
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:15,279
Messy? Messy?
It's ruined! It's ruined, Tigger.

795
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:19,158
Oh, why don't you ever stop bouncing?

796
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,828
Why? That's what tiggers do best.

797
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,915
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

798
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,751
Their tops are made out of rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

799
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,504
They're bouncy trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

800
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,839
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

801
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,551
I'm the only one

802
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,225
Order, please.

803
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,269
Now, I say,
Tigger's getting so bouncy nowadays,

804
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,980
that it's time we taught him a lesson.

805
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,691
No matter how much we like him,

806
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,070
you can't deny
he just bounces too much.

807
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,864
Excuse me, Rabbit.

808
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,285
Perhaps if we could think of a way
of un-bouncing Tigger,

809
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,371
it would be a very good idea.

810
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,375
Exactly! Just what I feel.
What do you feel, Pooh?

811
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,090
Pooh?

812
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,052
Haven't you been listening to Rabbit?

813
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,389
I listened, but then

814
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,851
I had a small piece of fluff in my ear.

815
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,645
Could you say it again, please, Rabbit?

816
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,730
Well, where should I start from?

817
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,692
From the moment the fluff got in my ear.

818
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,570
Well, when was that?

819
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,447
I don't know. I couldn't hear properly.

820
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:46,370
Pooh, we were trying to think of a way
to get the bounce out of Tigger.

821
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,248
I've got a splendid idea. Now, listen.

822
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,376
We'll take Tigger
for a long explore, see?

823
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,255
Someplace where he's never been,
and we lose him there.

824
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,882
Lose him?

825
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,426
Oh, we'll find him again, next morning.

826
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,095
Mark my words,
he'll be a humble Tigger.

827
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,930
A small and sad Tigger.

828
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,142
An, "Oh, Rabbit,
am I glad to see you" Tigger.

829
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,478
It will take the bounces out of him.

830
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,898
Now, all in favour say "aye."

831
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,858
Aye. Pooh?

832
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,235
Pooh!

833
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,030
- Here.
- Good.

834
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,449
Motion carried.

835
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,624
It was agreed they'd
start the next morning,

836
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,377
which, incidentally,
turned out cold and misty.

837
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:45,221
Pooh, as usual, had a little
something along to sustain himself.

838
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:53,312
And now, as Tigger kept bouncing
farther and farther into the mist,

839
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,981
Rabbit thought it was
a good time to lose Tigger.

840
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,776
Now's our chance. Quick!

841
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,153
In here. Hide.

842
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,619
Tigger's lost now, isn't he, Rabbit?

843
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,080
He's lost, all right, Piglet.

844
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,959
Oh, goody. This is lots of fun, Pooh.

845
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,470
My splendid idea worked.

846
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,015
Now, home we go.

847
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,185
Good! It's time for lunch.

848
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:37,022
- Hello!
- Oh, my goodness. Hide!

849
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,733
Hello!

850
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,240
That's funny. They must be lost.

851
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,245
Hello! Hello, hello, hello.

852
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,374
Hey, you blokes, where are ya?

853
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,877
- He...
- Shush.

854
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,462
I am shushed.

855
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,674
Hey, where in the heck are you guys?

856
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,233
Hello!

857
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:26,238
Rabbit? Piglet? Where are you?

858
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,282
Hello!

859
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,203
Hooray! Hooray, we've done it.

860
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,665
Come on, hurry. Let's head for home.

861
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:41,086
Rabbit was certain everything was
going according to plan,

862
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,088
and so it seemed to be.

863
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,927
But sometime later,
on the bottom of page 123...

864
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,607
It's a funny thing how everything
looks the same in the mist.

865
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,484
He's right, Piglet.

866
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,279
- It's the very same sand pit.
- I think so, too, Pooh.

867
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,783
It's lucky I know the forest so well, or...

868
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,286
Or we might get lost.
Well, come on. Follow me.

869
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,291
Now, Pooh was getting tired
of seeing the same sand pit,

870
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,753
and he suspected it
of following them about.

871
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,547
Because, whichever
direction they started in,

872
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,927
they always seemed to end up at it.

873
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,019
- Rabbit.
- Yes?

874
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,979
Say, Rabbit, how would it be

875
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,316
if as soon as we're
out of sight of this old pit,

876
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,153
- we just try to find it again?
- What's the good of that?

877
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:53,492
You see, we keep looking for home,
but we keep finding this pit.

878
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:58,580
I thought if we looked
for this pit we might find home.

879
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,791
I don't see much sense in that.

880
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:05,045
If I walked away from this pit,
and then walked back to it,

881
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,340
of course I should find it.
I'll prove it. Wait here.

882
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,515
So Pooh and Piglet
waited in the mist for Rabbit.

883
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:22,020
And they waited,
and waited, and waited.

884
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,524
And all the while,
Pooh's thoughts kept returning

885
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,192
to his honey pots at home.

886
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,409
What was that, Pooh?

887
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,203
My tummy rumble.

888
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,831
Now then, come on. Let's go home.

889
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,500
But, Pooh, do you know the way?

890
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:47,629
No, Piglet, but there are 12 pots
of honey in my cupboard,

891
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,549
and they have been
calling to my tummy.

892
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,675
They have?

893
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:56,555
Yes, Piglet. I couldn't hear them before,
because Rabbit would talk.

894
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,558
I think I know where they're calling from.

895
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,602
Come on. We'll just follow my tummy.

896
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:07,524
They walked off together
and, for a long time, Piglet said nothing

897
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,235
so as not to interrupt
Pooh's honey pots.

898
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,906
Sure enough, as the mist got thinner,

899
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:17,409
and just when Piglet
began to know where he was...

900
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,579
Hey, hello there, you two blokes.

901
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,831
Where have you been?

902
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,125
We've been trying to find
our way back home.

903
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:29,421
Pooh, I don't think
Rabbit's splendid idea worked.

904
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,342
Say, where is old long-ears, anyway?

905
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,428
He must still be missing in the mist.

906
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,224
Well, leave it to me.
I'll bounce him out of there!

907
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,851
T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now.

908
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:50,526
Meanwhile, Rabbit was
still wandering around in the mist.

909
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,195
By now, he was lost and bewildered.

910
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,697
And to make matters worse,

911
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,867
his mind was beginning
to play tricks on him.

912
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,580
What's that?

913
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,548
Pooh? Piglet?

914
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,176
- Help!
- Hello, Rabbit!

915
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,054
Tigger! But you're supposed to be lost.

916
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,183
Tiggers never get lost, bunny boy.

917
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,769
Never get lost.

918
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,813
- Of course not.
- Oh, no.

919
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,692
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's go home. Hang on!

920
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,237
They started back.

921
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,574
Rabbit was now a humiliated Rabbit,

922
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,659
a lost-and-found Rabbit,

923
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:27,247
an "Oh, why, oh, why,
do these things happen to me" Rabbit.

924
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,126
Now we come to the next chapter,

925
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,421
in which the first snowfall had
covered the Hundred Acre Wood.

926
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:38,508
And in which Tigger learns
that even bouncing can be overdone.

927
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,219
On this day,

928
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:44,556
Roo was waiting for Tigger
to take him out to play.

929
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,267
Mama, when is Tigger gonna get here?

930
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,146
Be patient, dear. He'll be here.

931
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,523
Well, here I am!

932
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,359
Did I surprise you, Roo?

933
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,070
You sure did! I like surprises.

934
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,491
- Hello, Mrs Kanga, ma'am.
- Why, hello, Tigger, dear.

935
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,868
She called me "dear."

936
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,497
Roo, are you ready for some bouncing?

937
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,999
Yeah! You and me are good bouncers.

938
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,752
Just a moment, dear.

939
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,339
Hold still.
Goodness, you're bouncy today.

940
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,883
That's what roos do the best-est.

941
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:24,930
- Now keep your scarf on.
- Not so tight, Mama.

942
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:28,100
- Is your sweater warm enough?
- Yes, Mother.

943
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,269
Well, come on, Roo. Let's go!

944
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,106
Tigger, have Roo home
in time for his nap.

945
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,066
And be careful!

946
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,153
Don't worry, Mrs Kanga.
I'll take care of the little nipper.

947
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,419
What a perfect day!

948
01:01:55,461 --> 01:02:00,340
Peace and quiet,
and thank goodness, no Tigger.

949
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,135
Say, look, look, look.

950
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,804
If it isn't old long-ears.

951
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,182
Can tiggers ice skate
as fancy as Mr Rabbit?

952
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,060
Can tiggers ice skate?

953
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,854
That's what tiggers do the best.

954
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,903
Say, this is a cinch.

955
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,324
Oh, no. Not him!

956
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,326
I can't... Watch out!

957
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,579
- It can't be!
- Out of my way!

958
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,289
Look out! I can't...

959
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,801
Oh, why does it always have to be me?

960
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,220
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

961
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,474
Tigger, Tigger, are you all right?

962
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,772
Tiggers don't like ice skating.

963
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,194
So Tigger and Roo went farther
into the Hundred Acre Wood

964
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,322
looking for something
that Tiggers do best.

965
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,325
I bet you can climb trees, Tigger?

966
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,620
Climb trees?
That's what Tiggers do best!

967
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,582
Only Tiggers don't climb trees.
They bounce them!

968
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,293
Come on, let's go.

969
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,511
I almost bounced clear out of the book.

970
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,137
Some bouncing.

971
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,977
Say, how did this tree get so high?

972
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:42,067
Hey. Hey! Hey!

973
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,860
What's happening now?

974
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,656
Don't swing on a string,
it's much too frail,

975
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,534
the best kind of swing is a tigger's tail.

976
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,205
Stop that, kid. Please.

977
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,082
S-T-O-P. Stop!

978
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,000
You're rocking the forest.

979
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,421
What's the matter, Tigger?

980
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,258
Oh, thank goodness.

981
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,720
I was just getting see-sick from
seeing too much.

982
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:16,017
We'll have to leave Tigger
up in the treetop for a little while.

983
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,521
Because, at the bottom
of the next page,

984
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,815
Pooh is having a problem of his own.

985
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,900
What are you doing, Pooh?

986
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,071
- Tracking something.
- Tracking what?

987
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,116
That's what I asked myself, Piglet.
What?

988
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,872
And what do you think
you'll answer yourself?

989
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,749
I shall have to wait
until I catch up with it.

990
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:44,296
Pooh, for a bear of very little brain,
you sure are a smart one!

991
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,047
Thank you, Piglet.

992
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,343
Now what?

993
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:54,180
A very mysterious thing, Piglet.

994
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,975
A whole new set of tracks. See?

995
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,020
And so it seemed to be.

996
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,939
There were the tracks
joining each other, here,

997
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,358
getting mixed up
with each other, there.

998
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:09,529
But to Pooh, quite plainly,
four sets of paw marks.

999
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:15,160
Piglet, whatever it was
that made these tracks,

1000
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,455
has now been joined
by a whatever-it-is.

1001
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,956
Yes.

1002
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,543
And all of them are
proceeding in company.

1003
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:27,047
Piglet, I wasn't exactly
expecting company.

1004
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,841
Neither was I, Pooh.

1005
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,471
So they went on,
feeling a little anxious now,

1006
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,933
in case the animals in front
of them were of hostile intent.

1007
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,851
Hello!

1008
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:49,361
Look, look, Piglet, there's
something in that tree over there.

1009
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:53,698
Is it one of the fiercer animals? Hello!

1010
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,743
Yes. It's a jagular.

1011
01:05:57,078 --> 01:06:00,872
What do jagulars do, Pooh?

1012
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,544
Well, jagulars always call, "Hello!"

1013
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,881
And when you look up,
they drop on you.

1014
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,759
I'm looking down, Pooh.

1015
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,428
Hello!

1016
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,890
Hey, Tigger, it's Pooh and Piglet.

1017
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,434
Pooh! Piglet!

1018
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,522
Why, it's only Tigger and Roo.

1019
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,065
Come on.

1020
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,403
Hello, Roo.

1021
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,280
What are you
and Tigger doing up there?

1022
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:38,159
I'm all right, but Tigger's stuck.

1023
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,331
Help, somebody, please.
Get Christopher Robin.

1024
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,668
It wasn't too long before word got back

1025
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:50,046
to Christopher Robin and the others
that Tigger was in trouble.

1026
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,676
Hello, Pooh. Hello, Piglet. What's up?

1027
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,888
- Tigger and Roo are up.
- Oh, my goodness.

1028
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,391
Roo, how did you get way up there?

1029
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:04,102
Easy, Mama. We bounced up.

1030
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,896
Oh, gracious. Do be careful, dear.

1031
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,692
I'm all right, Mama, but Tigger's stuck.

1032
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,945
Oh, what a shame. That's too bad.

1033
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,031
No, that's good.

1034
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,575
You see, he can't
bounce anybody up there.

1035
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,828
Oh, dear! We'll just have
to get him down, somehow.

1036
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,789
Down? Down? Do we have to?

1037
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,626
Come on, everyone.
Let's hold the corner of my coat.

1038
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,046
You're first, Roo. Jump!

1039
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,298
Try not to fall too fast, dear.

1040
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,470
Oh, thank goodness.

1041
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,222
Gee, that was fun!

1042
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,976
Come on, Tigger. It doesn't hurt. Jump!

1043
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,603
You're next, Tigger.

1044
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,814
- Jump!
- Jump?

1045
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,318
Tiggers don't jump. They bounce.

1046
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,320
Then bounce down.

1047
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:58,907
Don't be ri-dic-cour-ous.
Tiggers only bounce up!

1048
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,950
You can climb down, Tigger.

1049
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:06,498
But tiggers can't climb down,
because their tails get in the way.

1050
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,666
Hooray! That settles it.

1051
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,169
If he won't jump
and he can't climb down,

1052
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,797
then we'll just have to
leave him up there forever!

1053
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,965
Forever?

1054
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:20,845
If I ever get out of this,
I promise never to bounce again. Never!

1055
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,680
I heard that, Tigger.

1056
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,517
He promised!
Did you hear him promise?

1057
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,062
I heard him. I heard him!
You heard him, didn't you?

1058
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:34,442
Well, Tigger, your bouncing
really got you into trouble this time.

1059
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,945
Say, who are you?

1060
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,696
I'm the narrator.

1061
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,950
Please, for goodness sakes,
narrate me down from here.

1062
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,828
Very well. Hold on tight.

1063
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,875
You can let go, Tigger.

1064
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,545
Never.

1065
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:58,258
But, Tigger, look for yourself.
You're perfectly safe.

1066
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,808
What did I tell you, Tigger?

1067
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,769
Come on. Back we go.

1068
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,401
Good old terra firma.

1069
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,072
Say, I'm so happy, I feel like bouncing.

1070
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,241
You promised. You promised.

1071
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,411
Oh, I did, didn't I?

1072
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,999
You mean, I can't ever bounce again?

1073
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,208
Never!

1074
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,626
Never?

1075
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:43,344
Not even just one teensy,
weensy bounce?

1076
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,763
Not even a smidgen of a bounce.

1077
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:06,409
Oh, the poor dear. Oh, that's too bad.

1078
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:15,793
Christopher Robin,
I like the old, bouncy Tigger best.

1079
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,881
So do I, Roo.

1080
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,134
- I do, too.
- Me, too!

1081
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,555
Of course, we all do.
Don't you agree, Rabbit?

1082
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,310
- I... I...
- Well, Rabbit?

1083
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,146
Well, I... I...

1084
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,857
That is... What I mean...

1085
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,317
Well?

1086
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,944
I...

1087
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,656
Oh, all right.

1088
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,243
I guess I like the old Tigger better, too.

1089
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,664
Oh, boy!
You mean, I can have my bounce back?

1090
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,833
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's you and me bounce.

1091
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,169
Good heavens! Me bounce?

1092
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,922
Why, certainly!
Look, you've got the feet for it.

1093
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:05,009
- I have?
- Sure. Come on, try it.

1094
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,512
It makes you feel just great!

1095
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,473
Well, say, it does, doesn't it?

1096
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,017
Come on, everybody. Bounce!

1097
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,852
Come on, bounce.

1098
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,774
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

1099
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,402
Their tops are made out of the rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

1100
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:25,154
They're bouncy trouncy flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

1101
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:27,657
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

1102
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,867
I'm the only one

1103
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,085
And so, we come to the last chapter

1104
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:43,631
in which Christopher Robin and Pooh
come to the enchanted place.

1105
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,466
And we say goodbye.

1106
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:50,054
Goodbye? Oh, no, please, can't we go
back to page one and do it over again?

1107
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:54,517
Sorry, Pooh, but all stories
have an ending, you know.

1108
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,977
Oh, bother.

1109
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,896
Yes, the time had come at last.

1110
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,357
Christopher Robin
was going away to school.

1111
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,404
Nobody else in the forest knew
exactly why or where he was going.

1112
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:11,075
All they knew was it had something
to do with "Twice times,"

1113
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,537
and how to make
things called "ABC's,"

1114
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:17,457
and where a place called Brazil is.

1115
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,003
Pooh?

1116
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,213
What do you like doing
best in the world?

1117
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:28,760
What I like best is me going to visit you,

1118
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:32,805
and you saying,
"How about a smackerel of honey?"

1119
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,142
I like that, too.

1120
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,562
But what I like best
is just doing nothing.

1121
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,023
How do you do just nothing?

1122
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:45,902
Well, it's when grownups ask,
"What are you going to do?"

1123
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:50,740
And you say, "Nothing."
Then you go out and do it.

1124
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,201
I like that. Let's do it all the time.

1125
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,995
You know something, Pooh,

1126
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,623
I'm not going to do
just nothing any more.

1127
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,750
You mean, never again?

1128
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,794
Well, not so much.

1129
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:08,341
Pooh, when I'm away
just doing nothing,

1130
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,426
will you come up here sometimes?

1131
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,845
You mean, alone?

1132
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,306
- Just me?
- Yes.

1133
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,644
And, Pooh, promise
you won't forget me, ever?

1134
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,979
Oh, I won't, Christopher, I promise.

1135
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,190
Not even when I'm 100?

1136
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:27,819
- How old shall I be then?
- Ninety-nine.

1137
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,114
Silly old bear.

1138
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,199
Wherever they go,

1139
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:36,077
and whatever happens
to them on the way,

1140
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:40,039
in that enchanted place
on top of the forest,

1141
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,791
a little bear will always be waiting.

1141
01:13:42,305 --> 01:14:42,502
