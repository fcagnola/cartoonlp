3
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,934
Anna. Elsa.

4
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,267
Bedtime soon.

5
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,136
Uh-oh. The princess
is trapped

6
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:05,705
in the snow goblin's
evil spell.

7
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,507
Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!

8
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,744
Oh, no! The prince
is trapped, too.

9
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:12,579
Who cares about danger

10
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,613
when there's love?

11
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,547
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

12
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,349
Kissing won't save
the Forest.

13
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,853
The lost fairies cry out.

14
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,287
What sound
does a giraffe make?

15
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,389
Never mind.

16
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,658
They wake
the fairy queen...

17
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,526
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

18
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,963
And they all get married!

19
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,230
What are you playing?

20
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,932
Enchanted Forest.

21
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,466
The prince
and the princess...

22
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,670
Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen.

23
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,606
You've seen
an enchanted forest?

24
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,740
Wait, what?

25
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,609
I have. Once.

26
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:45,310
And you've never
told us this before?

27
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,546
Well, I could
tell you now, if you...

28
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,750
- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now.

29
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,286
Are you sure about this?

30
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,621
It's time they know.

31
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,321
Let's make
a big snowman later.

32
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,991
If they can settle
and listen.

33
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,194
Far away...

34
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,196
as north as we can go...

35
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:08,367
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

36
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,936
But its magic wasn't that of

37
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:12,672
goblin spells
and lost fairies.

38
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,744
<i>It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...</i>

39
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:17,946
<i>those of air...</i>

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,681
<i>of fire...</i>

41
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,917
<i>of water...</i>

42
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,518
<i>and earth.</i>

43
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:30,724
<i>But it was also home</i>

44
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,126
<i>to the mysterious
Northuldra people.</i>

45
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:35,662
<i>Were the
Northuldra magical, like me?</i>

46
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:38,430
<i>No, Elsa.
They were not magical.</i>

47
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:41,803
<i>They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts.</i>

48
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,605
<i>Their ways
were so different from ours...</i>

49
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,442
<i>but still,
they promised us friendship.</i>

50
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,309
<i>In honor of that,</i>

51
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,277
<i>your grandfather,
King Runeard,</i>

52
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,913
<i>built them a mighty dam...</i>

53
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,882
<i>to strengthen their waters.</i>

54
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,316
<i>It was a gift of peace.</i>

55
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:59,919
<i>That's a big gift of peace.</i>

56
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,286
<i>And I was so honored</i>

57
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:03,288
<i>to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it.</i>

58
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,626
Stand tall, Agnarr.

59
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,093
<i>I wasn't
at all prepared</i>

60
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,928
<i>for what the day would bring.</i>

61
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,801
<i>We let down our guard.</i>

62
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,270
<i>We were charmed.</i>

63
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,871
Whoa. Whoa!

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,074
<i>It felt so...</i>

65
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,276
<i>magical.</i>

66
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:38,457
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

67
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,063
<i>They were attacking us.</i>

68
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,965
Get behind me.

69
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,468
<i>It was
a brutal battle.</i>

70
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,036
<i>Your grandfather...</i>

71
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,104
Father!

72
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,172
<i>...was lost.</i>

73
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,505
Aah!

74
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,476
<i>The fighting
enraged the spirits.</i>

75
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:57,844
Look out!

76
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,180
<i>They turned
their magic against us all.</i>

77
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:12,093
<i>There was this voice...</i>

78
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,400
<i>...and someone saved me.</i>

79
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:26,005
<i>I'm told the spirits
then vanished.</i>

80
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:30,009
<i>And a powerful mist
covered the Forest.</i>

81
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,278
<i>Locking everyone out.</i>

82
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:41,555
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle.

83
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,093
Whoa, Papa, that was epic.

84
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,229
Whoever saved you,

85
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,363
I love them.

86
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:53,600
I wish I knew
who it was.

87
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,500
What happened to the spirits?

88
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,103
What's in the Forest now?

89
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,671
I don't know.

90
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,274
The mist
still stands.

91
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,209
No one
can get in.

92
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,111
And no one
has since come out.

93
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,579
So we're safe.

94
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,647
Yes.

95
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,349
But the Forest
could wake again.

96
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,552
And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring.

97
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,854
And on that note,

98
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,488
how about we say good night
to your father?

99
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,193
But I still
have so many questions.

100
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,895
Save them
for another night, Anna.

101
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:24,998
You know I don't
have that kind of patience.

102
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,835
Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?

103
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:30,904
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

104
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,875
Do you think the
Forest will wake again?

105
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,079
Only Ahtohallan knows.

106
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,115
Octa-who-what?

107
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:44,584
When I was little...

108
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:45,852
my mother
would sing a song

109
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:48,888
about a special river
called Ahtohallan...

110
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,125
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

111
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,993
About what we are
a part of.

112
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,061
Wow.

113
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,330
Will you sing it
for us? Please?

114
00:05:58,867 --> 00:05:59,899
Okay.

115
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,734
Cuddle close.

116
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,072

00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,228

Never mind.

150
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,860
- this could last forever.
- Mmm.

151
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,395
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

152
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,763
What's that?

153
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,565
Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

154
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,634
Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing...

155
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,736
do you ever worry
about the notion that...

156
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,605
nothing is permanent?

157
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,474

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,844
Doesn't matter. This is gonna

249
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,613
Two sisters, one mind.

250
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,214
- Thank you.
- Okay.

251
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:29,716

- Hmm.
- Anytime.

254
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,855
Just do it with your body.

255
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,088
Uh, nothing?

256
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,725

257
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:40,126

00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:45,732
- Sorry.
- Uh... Ugh.

262
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:46,867
You gotta
give me something.

263
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,001
Um...

264
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,970
Oh! Uh, alarmed?

265
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,806
Distracted?

266
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:55,274
Um, worried? Panicking?
Disturbed?

267
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,710
Oh, come on,

268
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,310
look disturbed.

269
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,579

271
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,784
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll turn in.

272
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:04,917
Are you okay?

273
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,253
Just...
Just tired.

274
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,421
Good night.

275
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:09,955
Yeah, I'm tired, too.

276
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,057
And Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story.

277
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,860
Didn't you, Sven?

278
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:14,927
Did I?

279
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,096
Oh, you do
the best voices!

280
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:19,599
Like when you pretend to be
Kristoff, and you're like...

281
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,735
"I just
need to go talk to some rocks

282
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,068
"about my childhood
and stuff."

283
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,805
Um, how about you guys

284
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,507
start without me?

285
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,078
Ugh.

286
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,047
Did Elsa seem weird
to you?

287
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,884
- She seemed like Elsa.
- Hmm.

288
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,285
That last word

289
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,353
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

290
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,055
- I don't know. Ahem.
- No. No.

291
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:44,726
- I don't know, but...
- Ah.

292
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:46,325
"Ice"?

293
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,027
Oh, come on!

294
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,095
She couldn't act out ice?

295
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,865
- I better go check on her.
- Uh...

296
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,702
- Thanks, honey. Love you.
- Hmm?

297
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,606
Love you, too.

298
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,508
It's fine.

299
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:04,713
Come in.

300
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:08,047
Yep. Something's wrong.

301
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,950
- With you?
- No, with you.

302
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,952
You're wearing
Mother's scarf.

303
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,986
You do that
when something's wrong.

304
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:15,988
Did we hurt
your feelings?

305
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,456
I'm so sorry if we did.

306
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,893
You know, very few people are
actually good at family games.

307
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:20,961
That's just a fact.

308
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,429
No, that's not it.

309
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:24,999
Then, what is it?

310
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,170
There's this...

311
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,908

mess things up.

You're doing great.

313
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,146
Oh, Elsa,
when are you going to see yourself

314
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,584

315
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:46,753
What would I do without you?

316
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,090
You'll always have me.

317
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,157

370
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,973
The water!

371
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:43,183
The air rages,
no fire, no water.

372
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,784
The earth is next.

373
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,919
We have to get out.

374
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:57,331
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

375
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,736
Oh, no!
I'm gonna blow!

376
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:05,339
I've got you!

377
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:15,815
Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

378
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,218
- Here. Take one of these.
- Huh?

379
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,484
You okay there, Olaf?

380
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,287
Oh, yeah.
We're calling this...

381
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,158
"controlling what you can when
things feel out of control."

382
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,558
Okay, I don't understand.

383
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,228
You've been hearing
a voice

384
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,196
and you didn't think
to tell me?

385
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:31,631
I didn't want to worry you.

386
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,435
We made a promise not
to shut each other out.

387
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:38,905
Just tell me
what's going on.

388
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:42,342
I woke the magical spirits
at the Enchanted Forest.

389
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,542
Okay, that's
definitely not

390
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:45,178
what I thought
you were gonna say.

391
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,747
Wait. The Enchanted Forest?

392
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,716
The one
Father warned us about?

393
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:50,583
Yes.

394
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:52,151
Why would you do that?

395
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:54,553
Because of the voice.

396
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:57,489
I know it sounds crazy...

397
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:00,559
but I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

398
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:02,962
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

399
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:07,399
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

400
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:08,970
I can feel it.

401
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,403
Okay.

402
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:14,506
Oh, no. What now?

403
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:16,276
The Trolls?

404
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,180
- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!

405
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:21,114
Pabbie.

406
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:24,150
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

407
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:27,186
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

408
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:31,057
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

409
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,892
Why are they still angry?

410
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,328
What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?

411
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,132
Let me see
what I can see.

412
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:43,605
The past is not
what it seems.

413
00:22:44,438 --> 00:22:47,273
A wrong demands to be righted.

414
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:50,310
Arendelle is not safe.

415
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:53,880
The truth must be found.

416
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:54,983
Without it...

417
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:58,485
I see no future.

418
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,586
No future?

419
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,855
When one can see
no future...

420
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:07,026
all one can do
is the next right thing.

421
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:08,995
The next right thing

422
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,930
is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest...

423
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,564
and find that voice.

424
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:13,766
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

425
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:14,934
- and Sven?
- Hmm?

426
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,535
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

427
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:18,771
- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no.

428
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,473
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

429
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,176
Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain...

430
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:24,344
survived a frozen heart,

431
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:25,411
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

432
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,746
and I did it
all without powers,

433
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,348
so, you know, I'm coming.

434
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,682
Me, too. I'll drive.

435
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:31,384
I'll bring the snacks!

436
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:33,453
I will look
after your people.

437
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,553
Please make sure they stay

438
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,189
out of the kingdom
until we return.

439
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,690
Of course.

440
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,325
Let's let them know.

441
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:42,261
Anna, I am worried
for her.

442
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,663
We have always feared

443
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:46,432
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

444
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:49,971
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

445
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,842
I won't let anything
happen to her.

446
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,844
Hyah!

447
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,180
Who's into trivia?

448
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:02,749
I am. Okay.

449
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:05,418
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

450
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,620
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

451
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:08,921
Did you know
men are six times

452
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:10,623
more likely to be
struck by lightning?

453
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,825
Did you know gorillas
burp when they're happy?

454
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,428
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

455
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,397
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

456
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:18,698
Did you know
sleeping quietly

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,532
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

458
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:23,403
- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is.

459
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:24,604
- It's true.
- Definitely true.

460
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,039
No, it's the truth.

461
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,673
Well,
that was unanimous.

462
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,742
But I will look it up
when we get home.

463
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:33,946
They're both asleep.

464
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:37,018
So, what do you
wanna do?

465
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:42,188
Sven, keep us steady,
will ya?

466
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,725
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

467
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:46,859
- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?

468
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,728
Remember
our first trip like this...

469
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,863
when I said
you'd have to be crazy

470
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,665
to want to marry
a man you just met?

471
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,300
Wait, what? Crazy?

472
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:57,070
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

473
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:58,638
No. I did.

474
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,473
- You were...
- Huh?

475
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:01,674
...not crazy.

476
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,109
Clearly.

477
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,744
Just naive.

478
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:08,247
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

479
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:12,852
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

480
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,887
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

481
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,956
What? No, no.
I'm not saying

482
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,559
you're wrong, or crazy.

483
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,794
- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea.

484
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:23,496
I hear it.
I hear the voice.

485
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:25,465
You do?

486
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,634
Olaf, wake up.

487
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,374
- Whoa.
- Wow.

488
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,565
Whoa! What the...

489
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,921
Whoa.

490
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,729
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

491
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:31,232
I promise.

492
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,008
It's okay.

493
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,377
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

494
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,978
is a place
of transformation?

495
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,914
I have no idea
what that means...

496
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,782
but I can't wait to see

497
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:53,587
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

498
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,088
- Hey!
- What is this?

499
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,591
- No pushing.
- Stop it.

500
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,233
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast.

501
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,726
What was that?

502
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:04,397
No. No, no, no.

503
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,934
And we're locked in.

504
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:10,069
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

505
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,275
This forest is beautiful.

506
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,242
Ooh.

507
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:43,704
The dam. It still stands.

508
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:46,539
It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions.

509
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,040
But why?

510
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,876
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

511
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,978
What do you mean?

512
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,179
Well, if that dam broke...

513
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:55,214
it would send
a tidal wave so big

514
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,783
it would wash away
everything on this fjord.

515
00:27:57,785 --> 00:27:59,185
Everything?

516
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:01,722
But Arendelle's
on this fjord.

517
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:03,856
Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna.

518
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:05,358
It's gonna be fine.

519
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,226
Come here.

520
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,301
You know,
under different circumstances,

521
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:18,771
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

522
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:19,839
Don't you think?

523
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:20,906
Different circumstances?

524
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,308
You mean,
like with someone else?

525
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,943
What? No! No.

526
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,311
I'm saying...

527
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,713
Just in case we don't
make it out of here...

528
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:27,913
Wait, what?

529
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,315
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

530
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:30,651
No. No!

531
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:32,184
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

532
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,687
Well, technically the odds
are kind of complicated,

533
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,288
but my point is...

534
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,522
In case we die...

535
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,924
- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no.

536
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,192
- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point.

537
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,327
I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

538
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:42,763
Not in any
recent time will we die.

539
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,263
- Elsa!
- But way far in the future,

540
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,564
we will die.

541
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,539
Don't patronize me.

542
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,648
Elsa!

543
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,982
There you are.

544
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,251
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

545
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:06,921
Okay, good.

546
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,057
Where's Olaf?

547
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,456
Um...

548
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,526
Anna?

549
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:13,459
Elsa?

550
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:14,996
Sven?

551
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,131
Samantha?

552
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,535
I don't even know
a Samantha.

553
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,608
Whoa!

554
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:30,278
Mm.

555
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,583
That's normal.

556
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:49,228
What was that?

557
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:51,265
Samantha?

558
00:29:56,237 --> 00:30:00,373
<i>♪ This will all make sense

This is fine.

579
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:27,761
- Whoa!
- Olaf!

580
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Hey, guys.

581
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:35,602
Meet the Wind Spirit.

582
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,104
Coming through!

583
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,473
Ooh, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

584
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:43,610
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

585
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,452
Hey! Stop!

586
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,400
Elsa!

587
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,272
Let her go!

588
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:17,044
Anna,
be careful!

589
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:19,280
That's my sister!

590
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,484
Prince Agnarr!

591
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,022
For Arendelle.

592
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:33,927
Look out!

593
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:36,783
Father!

594
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,140
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

595
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,811
What are these?

596
00:32:51,813 --> 00:32:55,849
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

597
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,717
What's that thing
you say, Olaf?

598
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,184
The thing... Oh!

599
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,186
My theory about
advancing technologies

600
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,589
as both our savior
and our doom?

601
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:05,057
No, not that one.
The one about...

602
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,292
- The one about cucumbers?
- No.

603
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:07,359
The thing about water.

604
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,996
Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory.

605
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,564
The water that
makes up you and me

606
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:13,800
has passed through
at least four humans...

607
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:15,737
and/or animals before us.

608
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:17,971
Hmm.

609
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:20,574
And remembers everything.

610
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,777
The wind's back.

611
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:26,012
Delicious.

612
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:28,817
I think
I'll name you Gale.

613
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,986
Get out of there. Whoa!

614
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:35,120
- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?

615
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,860
You in a better mood now?

616
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:52,340
Father.
That's Father.

617
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:55,675
This girl.

618
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:57,811
She's saving him.

619
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,211
She's Northuldra.

620
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,016
What is that?

621
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:04,820
Olaf, get behind me.

622
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:08,788
What are you gonna
do with that?

623
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,090
I have no idea.

624
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,571
Lower your weapon.

625
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:28,207
And you lower yours.

626
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,342
Arendellian soldiers?

627
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:32,277
Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?

628
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,081
Invading my dance space,
Yelena?

629
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,248
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

630
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,651
No, no, no.

631
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:38,718
Lieutenant!

632
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,786
Get the sword!

633
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,228
That was magic.

634
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,730
Did you see that?

635
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:52,899
Of course I saw it.

636
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:54,533
You chose a nice,
cold greeting.

637
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,368
They've been trapped in
here this whole time?

638
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,038
- Yeah.
- What do we do now?

639
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,240
I got this.

640
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,107
Hi, I'm Olaf.

641
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:05,912
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

642
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:08,148
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

643
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,016
It's really quite simple.

644
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:12,317
It began with two sisters.

645
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,186
One born with magical powers.

646
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,588
One born powerless.

647
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,523
Their love of snowmen,
infinite.

648
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,191
Anna, no! Too high!

649
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:20,426
Blast!

650
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:22,162
Mama! Papa! Help!

651
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,296
Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere.

652
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:26,365
Sisters torn apart.

653
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,467
Well, at least
they have their parents.

654
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,335
Their parents are dead.

655
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,271
Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

656
00:35:32,273 --> 00:35:33,606
I'll marry a man I just met.

657
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,075
Elsa's gonna blow!

658
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:37,443
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

659
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:39,679
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

660
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,246
I live.

661
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:44,017
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

662
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,752
Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!

663
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:47,887
- My heart.
- Oh, my goodness.

664
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,723
Only an act
of true love can save you.

665
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:51,760
Here's
a true love's kiss.

666
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,893
You're not worth it.

667
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:55,527
Guess what?
I'm the bad guy.

668
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,963
What?

669
00:35:56,965 --> 00:36:00,133
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

670
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:01,803
Oh, Anna.

671
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:03,737
Then she unfreezes!

672
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:05,437
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

673
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,906
and we were forced
out of our kingdom.

674
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,474
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

675
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:09,943
but we don't have a clue
how to do that...

676
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,310
except Elsa's hearing voices,

677
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:12,812
so we got that going for us.

678
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,348
Any questions?

679
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,754
I think they got it.

680
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:22,122
Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?

681
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:23,288
I am.

682
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,456
Why would nature reward

683
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,425
a person of Arendelle
with magic?

684
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,795
Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people.

685
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,496
My people are innocent.

686
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:32,531
We would have never
attacked first.

687
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,100
May the truth be found.

688
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:36,268
- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry.

689
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,104
- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm.

690
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:40,272
That's it.
Lieutenant Mattias!

691
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,108
Library, second portrait
on the left.

692
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,478
You were our father's
official guard.

693
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,646
Agnarr.

694
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:48,547
What did happen
to your parents?

695
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:51,818
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea...

696
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,921
six years ago.

697
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,860
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

698
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:01,928
Really?

699
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,395
Soldiers.

700
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:06,398
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

701
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,737
And proud to serve Arendelle.

702
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,938
Wait. Please.

703
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,007
Someone has called me here.

704
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:16,142
If I can just find them...

705
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:17,376
I believe
they have the answers

706
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:20,312
that may help us
free this forest.

707
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:22,548
Trust me,
I just want to help.

708
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,051
We only trust nature.

709
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:26,788
When nature speaks...

710
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:30,556
...we listen.

711
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:32,926
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

712
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:35,862
Fire Spirit!

713
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:38,965
Get back, everyone!

714
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,836
Head for the river!

715
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,112
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

716
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:54,115
Come on, Sven!

717
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:56,084
We'll get them.

718
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,922
Elsa! Get out of there!

719
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,891
No, no, no.

720
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,128
Elsa!

721
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,978
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

722
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,948
Anna!

723
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,255
Oh!

724
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:36,421
Get her out of here.

725
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,793
No! Elsa!

726
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,101
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

727
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,206
Got any advice?

728
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,275
Nothing?

729
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,610
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

730
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:09,582
You hear it, too.

731
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:11,651
Somebody's calling us.

732
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:14,454
Who is it?
What do we do?

733
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:24,899
Okay, keep going north.

734
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:28,701
Elsa!

735
00:40:28,703 --> 00:40:29,936
- Oh, thank goodness!
- Anna.

736
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:32,071
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

737
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:33,172
You could've been killed.

738
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,341
You can't just follow me
into fire.

739
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,542
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

740
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:40,545
then don't run into fire.

741
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:43,585
You're not
being careful, Elsa.

742
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,421
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

743
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,423
I've been better.

744
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:53,595
Hmm. I know
what you need.

745
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,633
Where did you
get that scarf?

746
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,367
That's a Northuldra scarf.

747
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:02,534
What?

748
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:05,471
This is from one of
our oldest families.

749
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:07,240
It was our mother's.

750
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:17,517
Elsa.

751
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,918
I see it.

752
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,054
It's Mother.

753
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:24,325
Mother saved
Father's life that day.

754
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:30,730
Our mother was Northuldra.

755
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:33,893
We are called Northuldra.

756
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:37,065
We are the people of the sun.

757
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:42,735
I promise you I will
free this forest...

758
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:44,239
and restore Arendelle.

759
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:47,574
That's a pretty
big promise, Elsa.

760
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:52,013
Free the Forest?
Wow.

761
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,580
I'm sorry.

762
00:42:53,582 --> 00:42:55,348
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

763
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,483
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

764
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:58,684
I get it.

765
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,653
- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

766
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,221
I heard the voice again.

767
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:03,689
We need to go north.

768
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:06,125
But the Earth Giants now
roam the north at night.

769
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,327
You can leave
in the morning.

770
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:09,495
I'm Honeymaren.

771
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:11,900
Honeymaren,
we'll do all we can.

772
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:16,769
Hey, let me ask you.

773
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:17,937
How do you guys cope...

774
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:20,072
with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

775
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:22,377
that comes with maturity?

776
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:24,844
Brilliant!

777
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,179
Oh!

778
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:28,347
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

779
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:29,749
Our future's
in bright hands.

780
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:31,083
Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that.

781
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:32,985
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

782
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,820
I can't seem
to get her attention.

783
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,455
Or even say
the right thing.

784
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:37,924
Well, you're in luck.

785
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:40,026
I know nothing
about women.

786
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:41,127
But I do know
that we have

787
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:44,130
the most amazing way
of proposing.

788
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:45,198
If we start now,

789
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,465
- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

790
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:47,668
Best part,

791
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,202
it involves
a lot of reindeer.

792
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,337
Whoa.

793
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:52,538
Hey,
back at home...

794
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,440
Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?

795
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:55,508
She is.

796
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,276
Really?
She married?

797
00:43:57,278 --> 00:43:58,411
Mm-mm.

798
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:01,582
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

799
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:03,284
What else do you miss?

800
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:05,686
My father.

801
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,722
He passed
long before all this.

802
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,524
He was a great man.

803
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:13,059
Built us a good life
in Arendelle.

804
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:16,028
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

805
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,397
He'd say, "Be prepared.

806
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:19,999
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

807
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:23,336
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

808
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:25,438
What do you do
when it does?

809
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,872
Don't give up.

810
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:30,443
Take it one step
at a time and...

811
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:33,246
Just do
the next right thing?

812
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:34,715
Yeah.

813
00:44:34,717 --> 00:44:35,950
You got it.

814
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,321
I wanna show you
something. May I?

815
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:47,594
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

816
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:48,928
Yes.

817
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,496
But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

818
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:54,200
said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature.

819
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:55,501
A fifth spirit?

820
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:56,769
Some say

821
00:44:56,771 --> 00:44:59,538
they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell.

822
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,207
My father heard it.

823
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:03,644
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

824
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:08,214
Maybe. Alas,
only Ahtohallan knows.

825
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:09,917
Ahtohallan.

826
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:15,855
<i>♪ Dive down deep

827

or you'll be drowned ♪</i>

828
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:22,228
Why do lullabies
always have to have

829
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,929
some terrible
warning in them?

830
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,865
I wonder
that all the time.

831
00:45:28,403 --> 00:45:30,202
Earth Giants.

832
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:32,106
What are they
doing down here?

833
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,542
Shh!

834
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:36,110
Hide.

835
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,320
They're coming!

836
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:58,132
This is why
we don't play with fire.

837
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:02,736
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

838
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:32,064
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

839
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:34,300
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

840
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:36,068
Or what if
they can crush you

841
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,304
before you even
get the chance?

842
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:41,974
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

843
00:46:41,976 --> 00:46:44,977
find the truth,
and get us home.

844
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:47,213
Hey, guys.
That was close.

845
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:48,514
I know.

846
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:51,016
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

847
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:53,519
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

848
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:54,855
And you're right, Anna.

849
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,823
We've got
to find the voice.

850
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:58,023
We're going now.

851
00:46:58,025 --> 00:46:59,558
Okay. We're going.

852
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,960
Let me just...

853
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:05,632
Wait. Where are
Kristoff and Sven?

854
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:08,401
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

855
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:09,636
and a bunch of reindeer.

856
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:10,936
- They left?
- Mm-hmm.

857
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:13,572
Just left
without saying anything?

858
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:15,611
Who knows
the ways of men?

859
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:25,585
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

860
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:27,021
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

861
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:28,822
Everyone ready?

862
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:29,955
Ready!

863
00:47:29,957 --> 00:47:31,157
Uh,
I could use a rehearsal.

864
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,224
I love love.

865
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,160
Wait. You talk
for them, too?

866
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:35,595
I do.

867
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:37,163
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

868
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:39,633
Yeah. And then
you just say it.

869
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,200
And then you just say it.

870
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:45,971
Okay. Here she comes.

871
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,442
Princess Anna
of Arendelle...

872
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:53,946
my feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

873
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:56,484
Will you marry me?

874
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:58,752
Um...

875
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:00,052
No.

876
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:02,087
The princess left
with the queen.

877
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:04,089
What? Wait,
what? What?

878
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:07,493
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

879
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:08,895
Long gone?

880
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:11,399
So, yeah.

881
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:15,167
Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows.

882
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:16,937
You can come with us
if you want.

883
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,845
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

884
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:27,446
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah. Yep.

885
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,817
Okay, I better go pack.
You coming with?

886
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:32,451
I'll just... Yeah,
I'll meet you there.

887
00:48:32,453 --> 00:48:34,654
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

888
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:36,021
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

889
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,391

938
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:31,925
Hey, Olaf, um,
maybe just one of you should do it.

939
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:33,993
I agree.
She's a little pitchy.

940
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:36,996
Hey, Gale's back.

941
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:43,805
What?

942
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:54,681
How can it be?

943
00:52:54,683 --> 00:52:55,717
What is it?

944
00:52:56,685 --> 00:52:58,718
Mother
and Father's ship.

945
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,688
But this isn't
the Southern Sea.

946
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,859
No, it isn't.

947
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:18,572
Why is their ship here?

948
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,342
How is it here?

949
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:25,277
It must have been washed in
from the Dark Sea.

950
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:27,649
What were they doing
in the Dark Sea?

951
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:31,316
I don't know.

952
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,020
How did the ship
get through the mist?

953
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:35,891
I thought nobody could but us.

954
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,493
Unless nobody was on it.

955
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:42,561
There's gotta be
something here.

956
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:45,330
Wait. Wait.
Look around.

957
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:48,034
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment.

958
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:49,403
Waterproof.

959
00:53:49,871 --> 00:53:51,738
That's very clever.

960
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,106
Although,
it does make me wonder

961
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,442
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

962
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:03,018
Here.

963
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,191
What language is this?

964
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:12,558
I don't know.

965
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,195
But look,
this is Mother's handwriting.

966
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:16,696
"The end of the ice age.

967
00:54:16,698 --> 00:54:18,865
"The river found, but lost.

968
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:22,737
"Magic's source.
Elsa's source?"

969
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:26,842
It's a map.

970
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:30,442
They traveled north

971
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:34,346
and planned to cross
the Dark Sea to...

972
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:36,348
Ahtohallan.

973
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,051
It's real?

974
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,285
Octa-who-what?

975
00:54:39,287 --> 00:54:40,820
Ahtohallan.

976
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,554
It's a magical river

977
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:45,058
said to hold all the
answers about the past.

978
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,028
Reinforcing my "water
has memory" theory. Mm.

979
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,732
Water has memory.

980
00:54:57,272 --> 00:54:59,371
Elsa?

981
00:54:59,373 --> 00:55:01,943
I wanna know
what happened to them.

982
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,751
<i>Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.</i>

983
00:55:11,753 --> 00:55:13,620
<i>We keep going
for Elsa.</i>

984
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:14,888
<i>The waves are too high!</i>

985
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,092
<i>- Iduna!</i>
<i>- Agnarr!</i>

986
00:55:20,494 --> 00:55:22,063
Elsa!

987
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:32,338
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

988
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,040
This is my fault.

989
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,643
They were looking
for answers about me.

990
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:39,979
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

991
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:41,983
No. Just their deaths.

992
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:43,983
Stop. No.

993
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:46,719
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

994
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:49,421
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

995
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:52,892
Because our mother
saved our father.

996
00:55:52,894 --> 00:55:54,928
She saved her enemy.

997
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,232
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

998
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,934
You are a gift.

999
00:56:00,936 --> 00:56:02,201
For what?

1000
00:56:02,203 --> 00:56:04,503
If anyone can resolve
the past...

1001
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:07,840
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

1002
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:09,375
it's you.

1003
00:56:09,377 --> 00:56:13,682
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

1004
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:23,056
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

1005
00:56:23,058 --> 00:56:26,392
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

1006
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:27,794
A fifth spirit?

1007
00:56:27,796 --> 00:56:30,863
That's who's been calling
me from Ahtohallan.

1008
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:33,969
The answers about the
past are all there.

1009
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:36,071
So we go to Ahtohallan.

1010
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:38,740
Not "we."

1011
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:40,907
- Me.
- What?

1012
00:56:40,909 --> 00:56:43,376
The Dark Sea is too
dangerous for us both.

1013
00:56:43,378 --> 00:56:46,245
No. No!
We do this together.

1014
00:56:46,247 --> 00:56:47,613
Remember the song?

1015
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,816
"Go too far and
you'll be drowned."

1016
00:56:49,818 --> 00:56:52,185
Who will stop you
from going too far?

1017
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:53,419
You said you believed in me,

1018
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:54,954
that this is
what I was born to do.

1019
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:58,224
And I don't wanna
stop you from that.

1020
00:56:58,226 --> 00:57:00,326
I... I don't
wanna stop you

1021
00:57:00,328 --> 00:57:02,195
from being whatever
you need to be.

1022
00:57:02,197 --> 00:57:04,797
I just don't want
you dying...

1023
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,068
trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

1024
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,336
Don't do this alone.

1025
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:13,239
Let me help you, please.

1026
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:15,043
I can't lose you, Elsa.

1027
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:20,715
I can't lose you
either, Anna.

1028
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:23,952
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1029
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:26,753
Wait, what?

1030
00:57:26,755 --> 00:57:28,421
What are you doing?

1031
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:29,691
Elsa!

1032
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,227
No! No!

1033
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:35,628
Olaf, help me stop.

1034
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,165
Give me a hand.

1035
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:42,235
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

1036
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:43,903
Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!

1037
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:45,705
Oh, come on!

1038
00:57:45,707 --> 00:57:47,874
Anna,
this might sound crazy...

1039
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:50,410
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

1040
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:52,879
Well, I am angry, Olaf!

1041
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:55,648
She promised me
we'd do this together!

1042
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,183
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1043
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:01,254
But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me.

1044
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:03,289
Wait, you're angry?

1045
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,425
Um, I... I think so.

1046
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:07,393
Elsa pushed me away,
too,

1047
00:58:07,395 --> 00:58:10,063
and didn't even
say goodbye.

1048
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:13,565
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

1049
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,169
And you said some things
never change.

1050
00:58:16,171 --> 00:58:17,537
But since then,

1051
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:20,708
everything's done nothing
but change.

1052
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:22,708
I know.

1053
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:26,245
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

1054
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:29,449
Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna.

1055
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:31,651
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

1056
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:34,420
Don't shush me. That's rude.

1057
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,622
No! No!

1058
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:48,568
Oh. The Giants.

1059
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,636
They're huge.

1060
00:59:06,654 --> 00:59:08,387
- Hang on, Olaf.
- Huh?

1061
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:15,330
Try not
to scream.

1062
00:59:28,977 --> 00:59:29,978
Found it.

1063
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:33,179
Thank you.

1064
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:35,348
Where are we?

1065
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,717
In a pit
with no way out.

1066
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:41,256
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

1067
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,028
Come on,
it'll be fun.

1068
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:50,863
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

1069
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:51,964
no one ever finds us...

1070
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:54,167
and you starve
and I give up.

1071
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:56,769
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

1072
00:59:56,771 --> 00:59:59,374
a whole lot
better than we are.

1073
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:38,079
Okay.

1074
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:49,991
Oh.

1075
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:00,935
Whoa!

1076
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,764
No!

1077
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:48,349
Whoa!

1078
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:13,408
No!

1079
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:42,168
Of course.

1080
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,341
Glaciers are
rivers of ice.

1081
01:02:47,776 --> 01:02:50,009
Ahtohallan is frozen.

1082
01:02:55,216 --> 01:02:56,849
I hear you.

1083
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:58,386
And I'm coming.

1084
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:08,094

I love you, Olaf!

1143
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:22,181
Come on,
you can do it.

1144
01:07:22,183 --> 01:07:24,416

with the face of a monkey!

1148
01:07:28,657 --> 01:07:30,724
I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

1149
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:32,291
But I'm great actually.

1150
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:34,663
Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

1151
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:36,896
I love you.

1152
01:07:36,898 --> 01:07:38,598
I need to tell you
about my past.

1153
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,666
And where I'm from.

1154
01:07:39,668 --> 01:07:41,067
I'm listening.

1155
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:43,103
Iduna!

1156
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:44,804
What are you reading,
Your Majesty?

1157
01:07:44,806 --> 01:07:46,173
Oh, some new
Danish author.

1158
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:56,181
King Runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1159
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:57,349
Grandfather?

1160
01:07:57,351 --> 01:07:59,518
We bring Arendelle's
full guard.

1161
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,422
But they have given us no
reason not to trust them.

1162
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:05,190
The Northuldra
follow magic.

1163
01:08:05,192 --> 01:08:07,127
Which means we can
never trust them.

1164
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,628
Grandfather?

1165
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,463
Magic makes people feel too powerful.
Too entitled.

1166
01:08:11,465 --> 01:08:15,902
It makes them think they
can defy the will of a king.

1167
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:17,871
That is not
what magic does.

1168
01:08:17,873 --> 01:08:19,471
That's just your fear.

1169
01:08:19,473 --> 01:08:21,710
Fear is what
can't be trusted.

1170
01:08:28,717 --> 01:08:31,250
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1171
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:32,888
so they will
have to turn to me.

1172
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:39,291
<i>♪ Dive down
deep into her sound</i>

1173
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:44,130
<i>♪ But not too far,
or you'll be drowned</i>

1174
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:46,365
They will come
in celebration.

1175
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,871
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

1176
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:54,974
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

1177
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:57,445
our neighbors, our friends.

1178
01:09:15,362 --> 01:09:18,164
King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

1179
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,899
It's hurting the Forest.

1180
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:21,300
It's cutting off
the North...

1181
01:09:21,302 --> 01:09:23,136
Let... Let's not
discuss this here.

1182
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:26,206
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

1183
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,909
Find a solution.

1184
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,452
No!

1185
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:47,963
Anna!

1186
01:09:57,072 --> 01:10:01,775
Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

1187
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:04,376
<i>You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,</i>

1188
01:10:04,378 --> 01:10:05,745
<i>so they will
have to turn to me.</i>

1189
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,379
<i>King Runeard, the dam,</i>

1190
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,281
<i>it's hurting the Forest.</i>

1191
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:15,922
Elsa's found it.

1192
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:17,322
What is it?

1193
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:19,326
The truth about the past.

1194
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:22,461
That's my grandfather...

1195
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,999
attacking
the Northuldra leader...

1196
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,603
who wields no weapon.

1197
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:33,775
The dam wasn't
a gift of peace.

1198
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:36,508
It was a trick.

1199
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,244
But that goes
against everything

1200
01:10:38,246 --> 01:10:39,681
Arendelle stands for.

1201
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,783
It does, doesn't it?

1202
01:10:44,552 --> 01:10:46,986
I know how to free
the Forest.

1203
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:51,390
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

1204
01:10:51,392 --> 01:10:53,595
Why do you say that
so sadly?

1205
01:10:54,361 --> 01:10:56,229
We have to break the dam.

1206
01:10:56,231 --> 01:10:58,765
But Arendelle
will be flooded.

1207
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:01,668
That's why everyone
was forced out.

1208
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,773
To protect them
from what has to be done.

1209
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:06,942
Oh. Oh!

1210
01:11:10,078 --> 01:11:11,644
Are you okay?

1211
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:14,015
I could really use
a bright side, Olaf.

1212
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:16,850
Bright side? Um...

1213
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:19,586
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

1214
01:11:19,588 --> 01:11:22,924
- Huh?
- And I see a way out.

1215
01:11:24,425 --> 01:11:26,493
I knew I could
count on you.

1216
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:34,399
Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

1217
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:35,770
We can meet her and...

1218
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:38,940
Olaf?

1219
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,009
What's this?

1220
01:11:41,442 --> 01:11:43,009
Are you okay?

1221
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,078
I'm flurrying?

1222
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,212
Wait. No. That's...

1223
01:11:46,214 --> 01:11:47,916
That's not it.

1224
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:52,986
I'm flurrying away.

1225
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:56,322
The magic in me is fading.

1226
01:11:56,324 --> 01:11:57,524
What?

1227
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:01,594
I don't think Elsa's okay.

1228
01:12:01,596 --> 01:12:03,965
I think...

1229
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:07,168
she may have gone too far.

1230
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,937
No. No.

1231
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:12,007
Anna?

1232
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,574
I'm sorry.

1233
01:12:14,576 --> 01:12:17,977
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

1234
01:12:17,979 --> 01:12:19,478
- Okay?
- Wait.

1235
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,214
Come here.

1236
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:23,517
- I've got you.
- Oh.

1237
01:12:23,985 --> 01:12:25,486
That's good.

1238
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:29,022
Hey, Anna?

1239
01:12:29,024 --> 01:12:32,191
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

1240
01:12:32,193 --> 01:12:33,527
What's that?

1241
01:12:34,129 --> 01:12:35,764
Love.

1242
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:38,166
Warm hugs?

1243
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:44,938
I like warm hugs.

1244
01:12:53,815 --> 01:12:55,617
I love you.

1245
01:14:01,548 --> 01:14:04,152
Olaf? Elsa?

1246
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:08,056

Wake up!

1294
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,026
That's it.

1295
01:18:07,028 --> 01:18:09,230
Come and get me!
Come on!

1296
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:16,637
Over here!

1297
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:21,642
That's right.
Keep coming.

1298
01:18:21,644 --> 01:18:23,177
Keep coming!

1299
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:30,918
That'll work.

1300
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:32,787
This way, guys!

1301
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:45,331
What?

1302
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,902
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

1303
01:18:58,246 --> 01:18:59,245
Kristoff!

1304
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:00,880
I'm here.
What do you need?

1305
01:19:00,882 --> 01:19:02,415
- To get to the dam.
- You got it.

1306
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:03,418
Thank you.

1307
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:21,300
Come on. Come on.

1308
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:23,402
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

1309
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,908
Lieutenant Mattias.

1310
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,477
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

1311
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:32,878
The dam must fall.

1312
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,481
It's the only way to break
the mist and free the Forest.

1313
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:38,250
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

1314
01:19:38,252 --> 01:19:41,722
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1315
01:19:41,724 --> 01:19:43,858
King Runeard
betrayed everyone.

1316
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:46,425
How do you know that?

1317
01:19:46,427 --> 01:19:49,097
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

1318
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:52,998
Please.

1319
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,036
Before we lose
anyone else.

1320
01:20:17,325 --> 01:20:18,491
Look out!

1321
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:27,834
Destroy the dam!
Come on!

1322
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:29,370
Throw your boulders.

1323
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:35,677
That's it.

1324
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,897
- I've got her!
- Anna!

1325
01:20:55,463 --> 01:20:56,863
Hang on!

1326
01:23:16,103 --> 01:23:18,705
I'm sorry
I left you behind.

1327
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:21,675
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

1328
01:23:21,677 --> 01:23:24,811
I know. I know.
It's okay.

1329
01:23:24,813 --> 01:23:26,480
My love is not fragile.

1330
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:29,450
Wow.

1331
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:32,386
Look at the sky.

1332
01:23:34,255 --> 01:23:36,923
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

1333
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:38,959
34 years...

1334
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:40,526
Five months...

1335
01:23:40,528 --> 01:23:43,230
And 23 days.

1336
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:55,902
Is it really you?

1337
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:57,971
Anna.

1338
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:01,775
I thought I'd lost you.

1339
01:25:01,777 --> 01:25:03,175
Lost me?

1340
01:25:03,177 --> 01:25:05,945
You saved me. Again.

1341
01:25:05,947 --> 01:25:07,080
I did?

1342
01:25:07,082 --> 01:25:10,050
And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall.

1343
01:25:11,953 --> 01:25:13,352
It didn't?

1344
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:15,622
The spirits all agreed.

1345
01:25:15,624 --> 01:25:18,758
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

1346
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:21,226
Me?

1347
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:24,296
You did what was right.
For everyone.

1348
01:25:24,298 --> 01:25:26,367
Did you find
the fifth spirit?

1349
01:25:28,335 --> 01:25:30,939
You are
the fifth spirit.

1350
01:25:31,606 --> 01:25:32,806
You're the bridge.

1351
01:25:32,808 --> 01:25:35,541
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

1352
01:25:35,543 --> 01:25:38,845
And Mother had
two daughters.

1353
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,047
We did this together.

1354
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:43,752
And we'll continue
to do this together.

1355
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:45,819
Together.

1356
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,789
Elsa! You're okay!

1357
01:25:51,392 --> 01:25:53,126
You look different.

1358
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:54,326
Did you cut your hair
or something?

1359
01:25:54,328 --> 01:25:57,296
- Or something.
- Oh.

1360
01:26:00,468 --> 01:26:04,104
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

1361
01:26:04,106 --> 01:26:05,939
Okay.

1362
01:26:05,941 --> 01:26:08,242
Do you want to build
a snowman?

1363
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:09,845
What?

1364
01:26:22,423 --> 01:26:25,961
Thank goodness
water has memory.

1365
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:39,304
Anna.

1366
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:41,674
Elsa!

1367
01:26:41,676 --> 01:26:44,244
Kristoff! And Sven!

1368
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:47,180
You all came back.

1369
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:50,482
Oh, I love happy endings.

1370
01:26:50,484 --> 01:26:51,918
I mean, I presume we're done.

1371
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,587
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

1372
01:26:54,589 --> 01:26:56,288
gonna be a regular thing?

1373
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:58,191
No. We're done.

1374
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:01,328
Actually,
there is one more thing.

1375
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:03,362
Anna,

1376
01:27:03,364 --> 01:27:06,132
you are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

1377
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:10,170
I love you with all I am.

1378
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:11,771
Will you marry me?

1379
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:13,338
Oh.

1380
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,342
- Yes!
- Ah.

1381
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:25,752
Aw.

1382
01:27:40,334 --> 01:27:41,868
Arendelle's okay.

1383
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,337
What?

1384
01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:45,905
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1385
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:47,240
Oh!

1386
01:27:47,242 --> 01:27:48,610
Hello.

1387
01:27:49,443 --> 01:27:53,012
You know,
you belong up here.

1388
01:27:53,014 --> 01:27:56,383
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

1389
01:27:57,285 --> 01:28:00,887
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

1390
01:28:00,889 --> 01:28:03,690
While I still don't know what
"transformation" means...

1391
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:08,029
I feel like this Forest
has really changed us all.

1392
01:28:12,767 --> 01:28:18,370
Presenting Her Majesty,
Queen Anna of Arendelle!

1393
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:26,980
Oh! Hello.
Hi.

1394
01:28:26,982 --> 01:28:29,983
Sven, don't you look nice.

1395
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,219
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

1396
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,221
Charmed, I'm sure.

1397
01:28:35,223 --> 01:28:37,190
Charming.

1398
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,660
Your Majesty.

1399
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,961
Kristoff.

1400
01:28:41,963 --> 01:28:44,764
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

1401
01:28:44,766 --> 01:28:46,966
It was Sven's idea.

1402
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:50,136
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

1403
01:28:50,138 --> 01:28:51,838
That's okay.

1404
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,940
I prefer you
in leather anyway.

1405
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,779
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

1406
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:03,283
The things we do for love.

1407
01:29:03,285 --> 01:29:05,084
What is this crazy magic
called again?

1408
01:29:05,086 --> 01:29:06,485
A photograph.

1409
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:08,487
Photograph. Huh.

1410
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:09,622
We look good.

1411
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:11,691
Halima. General Mattias.

1412
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:13,793
Uh, Your Majesty.
I'll be right back.

1413
01:29:13,795 --> 01:29:16,461
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

1414
01:29:16,463 --> 01:29:18,530
I'm just kidding.

1415
01:29:18,532 --> 01:29:20,702
- How am I doing?
- Fantastic.

1416
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:33,682
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

1417
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:42,588
Hi, Gale.
You like it?

1418
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:45,961
Oh, do you mind?
I've got a message for my sister.

1419
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:07,248
Thank you.

1420
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:11,884
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

1421
01:30:11,886 --> 01:30:14,519
"And don't worry,
