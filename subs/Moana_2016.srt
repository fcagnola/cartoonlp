<font color=#ff8000><i>In the beginning,</i></font>

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,484
<font color=#ff8000><i>there was only ocean,</i></font>

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,811
<font color=#ff8000><i>until the mother island emerged.</i></font>

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,808
<font color=#ff8000><i>Te Fiti.</i></font>

6
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,206
<font color=#ff8000><i>Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.</i></font>

7
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,329
<font color=#ff8000><i>It could create life itself.</i></font>

8
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,424
<font color=#ff8000><i>And Te Fiti shared it with the world.</i></font>

9
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,365
<font color=#ff8000><i>But in time,</i></font>

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,563
<font color=#ff8000><i>some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.</i></font>

11
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,847
<font color=#ff8000><i>They believed if they could possess it,</i></font>

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,640
<font color=#ff8000><i>the great power of creation would be theirs.</i></font>

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,966
<font color=#ff8000><i>And one day,</i></font>

14
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,325
<font color=#ff8000><i>the most daring of them all,</i></font>

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,848
<font color=#ff8000><i>voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.</i></font>

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,341
<font color=#ff8000><i>He was a demigod of the wind and sea.</i></font>

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,084
<font color=#ff8000><i>He was a warrior.</i></font>

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,564
<font color=#ff8000><i>A trickster.</i></font>

19
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,122
<font color=#ff8000><i>A shapeshifter who could change form,</i></font>

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,045
<font color=#ff8000><i>with the power of his magical fish hook.</i></font>

21
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,665
<font color=#ff8000><i>And his name,</i></font>

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,201
<font color=#ff8000><i>was Maui.</i></font>

23
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,163
<font color=#ff8000><i>But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble,</i></font>

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,360
<font color=#ff8000><i>giving birth to a terrible darkness.</i></font>

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,002
<font color=#ff8000><i>Maui tried to escape,</i></font>

26
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,846
<font color=#ff8000><i>but was confronted by
another who sought the heart.</i></font>

27
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,250
<font color=#ff8000><i>Te Kā!</i></font>

28
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,449
<font color=#ff8000><i>A demon of earth and fire.</i></font>

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,085
<font color=#ff8000><i>Maui was struck from the sky,</i></font>

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,681
<font color=#ff8000><i>never to be seen again.</i></font>

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,967
<font color=#ff8000><i>And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti,</i></font>

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,930
<font color=#ff8000><i>were lost to the sea.</i></font>

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,251
Where even now,

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,367
1,000 years later,

35
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,526
Te Kā and the demons of the deep,

36
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,522
still hunt for the heart.

37
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,645
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread,

38
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,247
chasing away our fish,

39
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,588
draining the life from island after island,

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,049
until every one of us is devoured,

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,890
by the bloodthirsty jaws,

42
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,646
of inescapable death!

43
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,645
But one day,

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,643
the heart will be found,

45
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,084
by someone who will
journey beyond our reef,

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,445
find Maui,

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,842
deliver him across the great ocean,

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,162
to restore Te Fiti's heart,

49
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,368
and save us all.

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,669
Thank you, Mother.
That's enough.

51
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,707
Papa.

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,782
No one goes outside the reef.

53
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,349
We are safe here.

54
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,223
There is no darkness.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,944
There are no monsters.

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,786
Monsters!

57
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,043
There's no monsters, no monsters,
It's the darkness!

58
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,759
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

59
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,886
I'm gonna throw up.

60
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,800
As long as we stay on our very
safe island, would be fine.

61
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,360
The legends are true.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,204
Someone will have to go.

63
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,562
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,370
Who would want to go anywhere else?

65
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,721
Moana!

66
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,238
There you are, Moana. What are you doing?
You scared me.

67
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,829
What? I wanna's go back.

68
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,973
I know, I know.

69
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:26,086
But you don't go out there.

70
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,521
It's dangerous.

71
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,221
Moana, come on.

72
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,562
Let's go back to the village.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,762
You are the next great chief of our people.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,923
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

75
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,281
Oh, yes. But first, you must
learn where you're meant to be.

I was only looking at the boats.

127
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,033
I wasn't gonna get on them.

128
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,782
Come on.

129
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,911
There's something I need to show you.

130
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,841
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

131
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,528
This is a sacred place.

132
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,729
A place of chiefs.

133
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,570
There will come a time,

134
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,600
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

135
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,927
Like I did.

136
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,629
Like my father did.

137
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,206
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

138
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,684
And on that day,

139
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,969
when you add your stone,

140
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,642
you will raise this whole island higher.

141
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,850
You are the future of our people, Moana.

142
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,071
And they are not out there.

143
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,029
They are right here.

144
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,724

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,782
Fixed!

168
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,926
Not the fronds.

169
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,644
Wind shifted the post.

170
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,923
That's good pork!

171
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,582
I didn't mean, I wasn't...

172
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,562
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta...

173
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:22,993
Bye!

174
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,686
You're doing great.

175
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,451
Is it done yet?

176
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,764
So close.

177
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,562
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

178
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,640
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

179
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,724
Should we maybe just cook him?

180
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,123
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

181
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,006
Far beneath in some cases.

182
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,542
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei
than meets the eye.

183
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,961
It's the harvest.

184
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,028
This morning, I was husking the coconuts and...

185
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Well...

186
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,159
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove...

187
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,640
There.

188
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,046
Thanks, Moana.

189
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,802
She's doing great.

190
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,566
This suits you.

191
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,760
Chief?

192
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,604
There's something you need to see.

193
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,909
Our traps in the east lagoon,

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,967
they're pulling up less and less fish.

195
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,767
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

196
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,087
We have. There's no fish.

197
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,543
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

198
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,687
We tried.

199
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,385
The windward side.

200
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,966
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

201
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,804
We've tried the whole lagoon.

202
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,121
They're just gone.

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,408
Have you tried using a different bait?

204
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,971
I don't think it's the bait.

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,605
There's no fish.

206
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,485
It seems like it's getting worse and worse.

207
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,203
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

208
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,099
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

209
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,990
What if we fish beyond the reef?

210
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,423
No one goes beyond the reef.

211
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,059
I know, but if there are no fish in the lagoon,

212
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,676
Moana.

213
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,198
And there's a whole ocean.

214
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,644
We have one rule.

215
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,162
An old rule, when there were fish.

216
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,084
A rule that keeps us safe.
But Dad, I...

217
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,991
instead of endangering our people,

218
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,971
so you can run right back to the water.

219
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,610
Every time I think you're past this.

220
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,280
No one goes beyond the reef!

221
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,903
Well, it's not like you said
it in front of your dad.

222
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,169
Standing on a boat.

223
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,341
I didn't say, go beyond the reef,

224
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,488
because I want to be on the ocean.

225
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,221
But you still do.

226
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,206
He's hard on you because...
Because he doesn't get me.

227
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,971
Because he was you.

228
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,649
Drawn to the ocean.

229
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,164
Down by the shore.

230
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,963
He took a canoe, Moana.

231
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
He crossed the reef,

232
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,846
and found an unforgiving sea.

233
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,384
Waves like mountains.

234
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,363
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

235
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,120
Your dad couldn't save him.

236
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,128
He's hoping he can save you.

237
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,370
Sometimes,

238
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,190
who we wish we were,

239
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,469
what we wish we could do,

240
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,148
it's just not meant to be.

I can do this.

285
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,884
There's more fish beyond the reef.

286
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,807
There's more beyond the reef.

287
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,490
Not so bad.

288
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,703
Whatever just happened,

289
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,246
blame it on the pig.

290
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,027
Gramma.

291
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,130
Are you gonna tell Dad?

292
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,490
I'm his mom.

293
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,946
I don't have to tell him anything.

294
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,726
He was right.

295
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,481
About going out there.

296
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,002
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

297
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,911
Okay.

298
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,087
Well, then head on back.

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,683
Put that stone up there.

300
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,284
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

301
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,027
You said that's what you wanted.

302
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,080
It is.

303
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,842
When I die,

304
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,528
I'm going to come
back as one of these.

305
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,809
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

306
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,644
Why are you acting weird?

307
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,105
I'm the village crazy lady.

308
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,551
That's my job.

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,030
If there's something you want to tell me,

310
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:20,164
just tell me!

311
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,848
Is there something you wanna tell me?

312
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,844
Is there something you want to hear?

313
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,183
You've been told all our people's stories,

314
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,203
but one.

315
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,944
What is this place?

316
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,490
Do you really think our
ancestors stayed within the reef?

317
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,809
What's in there?

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,482
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

319
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,651
Who are you meant to be?

320
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,483
Go inside,

321
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,410
bang the drum,

322
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,887
and find out.

323
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,005

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,605
Why'd we stop?

345
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,806
Maui.

346
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,986
When he stole from the mother island,

347
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,230
darkness fell.

348
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,483
Te Kā awoke.

349
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,403
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

350
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,839
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging,

351
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

352
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,925
And the darkness has continued to spread,

353
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,203
chasing away our fish,

354
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,130
draining the life,

355
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,887
from island after island.

356
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,123
Our island.

357
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,563
But, one day,

358
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,849
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui,

359
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,923
deliver him across the great ocean,

360
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,747
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

361
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,202
I was there that day.

362
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,210
The ocean chose you.

363
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,228
I thought it was a dream.

364
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,463
Nope!

365
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,445
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there,

366
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,364
at the bottom of his hook.

367
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,650
Follow it, and you will find him.

368
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,247
But why would it choose me?

369
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,482
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

370
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,948
But I know who does!

371
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,959
The crops are turning black.
What about the fish?

372
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,359
This is happening all over the island.

373
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,880
Please, please settle down.
What are you going to do?

374
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,960
We will dig new fields.

375
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,048
We will find a way to...
We can stop the darkness!

376
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:12,430
Save our island!

377
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,125
There's a cavern of boats.

378
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,810
Huge canoes.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,560
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

380
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,419
We were voyagers.

381
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,227
We can voyage again!

382
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,044
You told me to help our people.

383
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,441
This is how we help our people.

384
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
Dad?

385
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,961
What are you doing?

386
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:35,798
I should've burned those
boats a long time ago!

387
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,846
No! Don't!

388
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,238
We have to find Maui.

389
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:39,894
We have to restore the heart!

390
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,027
There is no heart!

391
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,242
This... This is just a rock!

392
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,268
No!

393
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,582
Chief! It's your mother!

394
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,165
Mother.

395
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,805
What can be done?

396
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,121
Go.

397
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,009
Gramma.

398
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,727
Go.

399
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,726
Not now. I can't.

400
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,201
You must!

401
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,762
The ocean chose you.

402
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Follow the fish hook.

403
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,601
Gramma.

404
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,842
And when you find Maui,

405
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,840
you grab him by the ear.
You say,

406
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,243
I am Moana of Motunui.

407
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,847
You will board my boat,

408
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,402
sail across the sea,

409
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,565
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

410
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,727
I can't leave you.

411
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,411
There is nowhere you could
go that I won't be with you.

412
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,371

433

sail across the sea,

434
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,213
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

435
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,910
I am Moana...

436
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,487
of Motu...

437
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,246
nui.

438
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,881
Heihei?

439
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,791
It's okay.

440
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:07,574
You're all right.

441
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,240
See?

442
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,045
There we go.

443
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,574
Nice water.

444
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,125
The ocean is a friend of mine.

445
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,346
Heihei?

446
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,760
Heihei!

447
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,941
Stay.

448
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,800
Okay.

449
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,907
Next stop, Maui.

450
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,671
I am Moana of Motunui.

451
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,589
You will board my boat,

452
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,682
sail, across the sea,

453
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,067
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

454
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,123
I am Moana of Motu...

455
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,530
Board my boat!

456
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,561
Oh, no.

457
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,568
No, no, no!

458
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,005
Ocean,

459
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,090
can I get a little help?

460
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,686
No, no.

461
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,081
Please.

462
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,481
Come on!

463
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,291
Help me!

464
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Please!

465
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,005
What?

466
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,969
I said help me!

467
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,282
And wrecking my boat?

468
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,449
Not helping!

469
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,043
Fish pee in you all day!

470
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,326
So,

471
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,282
Maui?

472
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,840
Maui!

473
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,606
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea,

474
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,489
I am Moana of Motunui.

475
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,210
You will board my boat.

476
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,282
No. You will board my boat.

477
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,204
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

478
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,126
You will board my...

479
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,260
Boat! A boat!

480
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,250
The gods have given me a...

481
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,364
Maui, shapeshifter,

482
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,483
demigod of the wind and sea,

483
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,599
I am Moana of...
Hero of men.

484
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,961
What?

485
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,831
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea,

486
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,161
hero of men.

487
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,244
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

488
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,201
I am...

489
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,521
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

490
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,001
And women. Men and women.

491
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,001
Both. All.

492
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,925
Not a guy, girl thing.

493
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,844
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

494
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,126
You're doing great.

495
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,458
What? No! I'm here to...

496
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,621
Of course. Of course.

497
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

498
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,447
Maui always has time for his fans.

499
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,007
When you use a bird to write with,

500
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,364
it's called tweeting.

501
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,965
I know, not every day,
you get a chance to meet your hero.

502
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,844
You are not my hero.

503
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,565
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

504
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,166
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

505
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,568
And you will board my boat,

506
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,929
and sail across the sea and put it back!

507
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,340
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me,

508
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,079
which is impossible because,
I got stuck here for 1,000 years,

509
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,519
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

510
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,849
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

511
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,349
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say,

512
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,686
is thank you.

513
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,240
Thank you?
You're welcome.

514
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,442
What? No, no, no!

515
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,179
I didn't, I wasn't,

516
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,485
Why would I ever say...

I'm going to get my hook.

585
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,989
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

586
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,487
Okay, talk to the back.

587
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,981
Boat snack.

588
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,527
Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.

589
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,661
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

590
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,190
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

591
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,088
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

592
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,507
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

593
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,126
I could watch that all day.

594
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,963
Okay. Enjoy the island.

595
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,485
Maui, out.

596
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,971
No! Stop!

597
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,164
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

598
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,409
Did not see that coming.

599
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:13,603
I am Moana of Motunui.

600
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,920
This is my canoe,

601
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,849
and you will journey to...

602
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,784
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.

603
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,106
And she's back.

604
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,929
I am Moana of Motunui...

605
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,639
It was Moana, right?

606
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,503
Yes.

607
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,907
And you will restore the heart!

608
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,286
All right. I'm out.

609
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,786
Oh, come on!

610
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,443
What is your problem?

611
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,590
Are...

612
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:03,358
you afraid of it?

613
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,724
No! No.

614
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,242
I'm not afraid.

615
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,242
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

616
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,501
You, stop it.

617
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,094
That is not a heart.

618
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,268
It is a curse.

619
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,878
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky,

620
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,985
and I lost my hook.

621
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:21,400
Get it away from me.

622
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,251
Get this away?

623
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,003
I'm a demigod, okay?
Stop that. I will smite you!

624
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,744
You wanna get smote?

625
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,001
Smotten?

626
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,585
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life,

627
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,568
it's a homing beacon of death.

628
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,106
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

629
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,369
Come for this? The heart?

630
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,000
You mean this heart right here?
Don't, you can't raise your voice like that!

631
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,188
Come and get it!

632
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,519
You are gonna get us killed!

633
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,722
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,

634
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:49,152
so you can put it back.

635
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:51,501
Thank you.
You're welcome.

636
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:57,900
Kakamora.

637
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,045
Kaka-what?

638
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,610
Murdering little pirates.

639
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:04,110
Wonder what they're here for.

640
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,961
They're kinda cute.

641
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,722
Ocean!

642
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,623
Do something! Help us!

643
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,347
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

644
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,010
Tighten the halyard.
Bind the stays!

645
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,847
You can't sail?

646
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:42,250
I am self-taught.

647
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,847
Can't you shapeshift or something?

648
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,086
Do you see my hook?

649
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,083
No magic hook, no magic powers!

650
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,726
Their boat is turning into more boats!

651
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,485
Yep, I just did that.

652
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,521
No, no, no, no, no!

653
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,681
Heihei!

654
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,920
Maui!

655
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,262
They took the heart!

656
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:17,688
That's a chicken.

657
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,045
The heart is in the...

658
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,764
We have to get him back!

659
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:27,840
Maui!

660
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,884
There! Right there!

661
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,068
You're turning?

662
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,342
What are you doing?

663
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,905
Escaping!

664
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,166
The heart!

665
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,923
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

666
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,880
Besides, you got a better one.

667
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,869
What am I gonna steer with?

668
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,085
They're just gonna kill ya!

669
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,561
Coconuts.

670
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,646
Got it!

671
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:11,561
We did it!

672
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:14,929
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

673
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,380
You surprise me.

674
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,041
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

675
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,565
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

676
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,101
Not to mention Te Kā.

677
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:27,851
Lava monster?

678
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,030
Ever defeat a lava monster?

679
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:31,311
No.

680
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,505
Have you?

681
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,648
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

682
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,949
You can't restore the heart without me,

683
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:48,864
and me says no.

684
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,251
I'm getting my hook.

685
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
End of discussion.

686
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,402
You'd be a hero.

687
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:06,802
That's what you're all about, right?

688
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,981
Little girl...

689
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:09,827
I am a hero.

690
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,449
Maybe you were.

691
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,626
But now...

692
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,804
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

693
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,880
The guy who cursed the world.

694
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:21,126
You're no one's hero.

695
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,628
No one?

696
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,007
But...

697
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,050
put this back,

698
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,043
save the world,

699
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,208
you'd be everyone's hero.

701
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,449
You're so amazing!

702
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:51,630
We'd never make it without my hook.

703
00:50:51,956 --> 00:50:52,795
Not past Te Kā.

704
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,045
Then we get your hook.

705
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,487
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

706
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:00,690
Unless you don't wanna be,

707
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,969
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

708
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,471
Hero to...

709
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,240
all.

710
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,409
First, we get my hook.

711
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,210
Then save the world.

712
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,400
Deal?

713
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,621
Deal.

714
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:21,887
Worth a shot.

715
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,447
Okay, we go east.

716
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,005
To the lair of Tamatoa.

717
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,686
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

718
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,565
Teach me to sail.

719
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,248
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

720
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I should...

721
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,682
I should be sailing.

722
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,889
It's called wayfinding, princess.

723
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,409
And it's not just sails and knots,

724
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,166
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

725
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,009
Knowing where you are,

726
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,106
by knowing where you've been.

727
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,681
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

728
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:12,286
I am the daughter of the chief.

729
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,641
Same difference.
No.

730
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,451
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick,

731
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:17,646
you're a princess.

732
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,380
You are not a wayfinder.

733
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,182
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

734
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,246
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

735
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:38,364
You are a bad person.

736
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,244
If you can talk, you can teach.

737
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Wayfinding.

738
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:43,679
Lesson one.

739
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:45,003
Hit it.

740
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,121
Pull the sheet.

741
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,340
Not the sheet.

742
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:51,599
No.

743
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:52,407
Nope.

744
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,829
Nope. No.

745
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,643
Tried that one already.

746
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,920
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

747
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,210
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

748
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,510
It's cold.

749
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,762
Wait, it's getting warmer.

750
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,528
That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

751
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:37,480
We're here?

752
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,646
See, told you I could do it!

753
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,400
Motunui?

754
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,204
I'm home?

755
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,483
Moana!
Dad?

756
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,923
Moana!

757
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,242
Mom?

758
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:04,885
Help!

759
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,483
No!

760
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,405
Moana!

761
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,969
Enjoy your beauty rest?

762
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,846
You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps,

763
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,650
so they actually get
where they need to go.

764
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,565
Muscle up, buttercup.

765
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,809
We're here.

766
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,447
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

767
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,842
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

768
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,985
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

769
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,768
And for Tamatoa, trust me,

770
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,485
my hook is the coolest collectible.

771
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,360
And he lives up there?

772
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,588
Oh no, no, no, no.

773
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,170
That's just the entrance,

774
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,327
to...

775
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:50,478
Lalotai.

776
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,722
Lalotai?

777
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:53,884
Realm of monsters?

778
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:56,362
We're going to the realm of monsters?

779
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,047
We? No. Me.

780
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,000
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

781
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,010
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

782
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,681
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

783
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,001
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

784
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,889
I know she's human, but that's not the...

785
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,605
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

786
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,150
I'm not explaining it to you.

787
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,003
'Cause then it's not funny.

788
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,882
So, daughter of the chief,

789
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,530
I thought you stayed in the village.

790
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,250
You know, kissing babies and things.

791
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,400
Hey, I'm just trying to understand,

792
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,880
why your people decided to send,

793
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,963
How do I phrase this? You.

794
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,434
My people...

795
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,393
didn't send me.

796
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:50,880
The ocean did.

797
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,280
The ocean?

798
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,179
Makes sense, you're what, eight?
Can't sail.

799
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,282
Obvious choice.

800
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,121
It chose me for a reason.

801
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,949
If the ocean's so smart,

802
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,623
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

803
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,884
Or bring me my hook?

804
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,407
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

805
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,369
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

806
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,106
You're the Chosen One!

807
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,307
The ocean chose you for a reason.

808
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,985
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

809
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,007
So, not seeing an entrance.

810
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,327
Yes, because it only appears,

811
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,523
after a human sacrifice.

812
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,391
Kidding.

813
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,119
So serious.

814
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,686
Don't worry,

815
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,128
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

816
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:25,570
I am still falling!

817
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:28,965
You can do this.

818
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,686
Go!

819
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,451
And he sticks the landing.

820
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,121
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

821
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,666
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of,

822
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:09,003
Well, she's dead.

823
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,682
Okay, let's get my hook.

824
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,802
Maui's fishhook!

825
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Yeah!

826
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:18,240
Sorry!

827
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,286
I thought you were a monster,

828
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,800
But I found your hook.

829
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,222
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

830
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Stay.

831
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,646
What? No.
I'm the one who found,

832
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,326
Listen. For a thousand years,

833
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,786
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky,

834
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,920
getting my hook,

835
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,650
and being awesome again.

836
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,047
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal,

837
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,086
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except,

838
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,224
Except,

839
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,527
maybe as bait.

840
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,047
The shiny, glittery cave.

841
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:51,530
And just like me,

842
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,246
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

843
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,108
Sparkle, sparkle,

844
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,846
sparkle.
You're not selling it!

845
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,202
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

846
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,344
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

847
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:07,141
When he shows up, keep him distracted.

848
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,889
Make him talk about himself.

849
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:11,047
He loves bragging about how great he is.

850
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,849
You two must get along swell.

851
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,851
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

852
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,170
You ripped off his,

853
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,362
Maui?

854
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,760
What have we here?

855
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:34,447
It's a sparkly, shiny, Wait a minute.

856
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,567
It's a human!

857
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:41,327
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the mons...

858
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:42,760
Just pick an eye, babe.

859
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:45,360
I can't, I can't concentrate on what
I'm saying if you keep...

860
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,965
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

861
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,800
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

862
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,490
Don't! That's my gramma's!

863
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:52,561
That's my gramma's!

864
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:53,800
I ate my gramma!

865
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,447
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

866
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:58,045
Why are you here?

867
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,804
'Cause you're amazing!

868
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:06,371
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

869
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,887
And I just had to know,

870
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:11,302
how you became so...

871
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,681
crabulous?

872
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,702
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

873
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,125
Because if you are,

874
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,621
I will gladly do so.

875
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,960

I got something shiny for ya!

938
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,327
The heart of Te Fiti.

939
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,721
You can't run from me!

940
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,565
Oh, you can.
You keep surprising me.

941
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,403
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

942
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,483
The power of creation,

943
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,204
for a crustacean.

944
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,889
Where is it? Where is it?

945
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,164
We gotta go!

946
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
What about the heart?

947
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,253
He can have it.

948
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:13,603
I've got a better one.

949
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,170
Yes, I have the...

950
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
Wait a minute.

951
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,661
I see, she's taken a barnacle,

952
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:23,583
and she's covered it in
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

953
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:27,202
Come back here!

954
01:05:33,894 --> 01:05:34,695
Hey!

955
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:35,880
Hey!

956
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:37,690
Did you like the song?

957
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,626
We're alive!

958
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:48,150
We're a live...

959
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:50,681
Listen,

960
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,563
I appreciate what you did down there.

961
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,282
Took guts.

962
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,521
But...

963
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,867
I'm sorry.

964
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,268
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

965
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:02,269
No, no.

966
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:03,458
No way!

967
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,581
Really? Because you're looking
at me like I have a...

968
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:09,586
shark head.

969
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,610
What?

970
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:13,159
Do you have a shark head?
Cause I...

971
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:14,630
Look, the point is...

972
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,003
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever,

973
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,286
who had no business being down there,

974
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,405
you did me a solid.

975
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,688
But you also almost died.

976
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:26,699
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

977
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:29,242
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

978
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,561
Bupkis.

979
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:32,820
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

980
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,186
This mission is cursed.

981
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,706
It's not cursed.

982
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:37,161
Shark head.

983
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,806
It is not cursed.

984
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,081

Nunya business.

1003
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,840
I'll just keep asking.

1004
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,181
What's it for?

1005
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,442
You need to stop doing that.

1006

Back off.
Just tell me what it is.

1007
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,851
I said back off.

1008
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:10,583
Is it why your hook's not working?

1009
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,489
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1010
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,921
You wanna throw me off the boat,

1011
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,863
throw me off.

1012
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:37,341
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing,

1013
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,564
I know I don't.

1014
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,729
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1015
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,609
You're right.

1016
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:50,204
But my island is dying,

1017
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,122
so I am here.

1018
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,087
It's just me and you.

1019
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,925
And I want to help,

1020
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,368
but I can't if you don't let me.

1021
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,286
I wasn't born a demigod.

1022
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,127
I had human parents.

1023
01:09:16,055 --> 01:09:17,055
They...

1024
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,139
took one look,

1025
01:09:19,963 --> 01:09:21,051
and decided,

1026
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,801
they did not want me.

1027
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,547
They threw me into the sea,

1028
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,128
like I was nothing.

1029
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,082
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1030
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,925
They gave me the hook.

1031
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,805
They made me,

1032
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Maui.

1033
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,725
And back to the humans I went.

1034
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:48,970
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1035
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,201
Anything they could ever want.

1036
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,287
You took the heart for them.

1037
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,890
You did everything for them.

1038
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,488
So they'd love you.

1039
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,248
It was never enough.

1040
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,728
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1041
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,042
Maybe the ocean brought you to them,

1042
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:24,329
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1043
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,167
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1044
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,079
You are.

1045
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,363
Okay, okay.

1046
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:45,845
I love you too buddy.

1047
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,643
Yeah!

1048
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,650
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1049
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:07,341
What?

1050
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,130
I figured it out.

1051
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:14,201
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands,

1052
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,159
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1053
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,764
All those new lands, new villages.

1054
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,560
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1055
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,649
And if I were the ocean,

1056
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,885
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess,

1057
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,483
to start that again.

1058
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,443
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1059
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,408
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

1060
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,921
I did.

1061
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,887
Moana of Motunui,

1062
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:54,770
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1063
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:58,659
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1064
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,569
You're so amazing!

1065
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:03,367
It's time.

1066
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,210
Go save the world.

1067
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,060
Maui!

1068
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,845
What are you doing?

1069
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,804
Finding you a better way in!

1070
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,509
We won't make it!
Yes, we will!

1071
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,481
Turn around!
No!

1072
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,568
Moana, stop!
No!

1073
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,644
Are you okay?

1074
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:05,201
Maui?

1075
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,929
I told you to turn back.

1076
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,923
I thought we could make it.

1077
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:20,242
We?

1078
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,962
I thought I could make it.

1079
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,046
We can fix it.

1080
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,328
It was made by the gods.

1081
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,203
You can't fix it!

1082
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,728
Next time we'll be more careful.

1083
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:36,087
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1084
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,685
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1085
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,442
We can find a way around.

1086
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,842
I'm not going back.

1087
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:45,729
We still have to restore the heart.

1088
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:47,345
My hook is cracked.

1089
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,439
One more hit, and it's over.

1090
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,483
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1091
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,618
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1092
01:16:53,619 --> 01:16:54,780
That's not true!

1093
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,225
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1094
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,159
We are only here,

1095
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,189
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1096
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,759
No, we're here because the
ocean told you you're special,

1097
01:17:15,859 --> 01:17:17,302
and you believed it.

1098
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,079
I am Moana of Motunui.

1099
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,787
You will board my boat,
Goodbye, Moana.

1100
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,726
Sail across the sea,

1101
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:26,238
I'm not killing myself,

1102
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,579
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1103
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,225
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1104
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,801
The ocean chose me!

1105
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,444
It chose wrong.

1106
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,440
Maui!

1107
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:02,920
Why did you bring me here?

1108
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,807
I'm not the right person.

1109
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,344
You have to choose someone else.

1110
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,331
Choose someone else.

1111
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,350
Please.

1112
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,600
No.

1113
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,201
You're a long ways past the reef.

1114
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:03,360
Gramma?

1115
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:08,369
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1116
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,305
Gramma!

1117
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,068
I tried, Gramma. I...

1118
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:21,163
I couldn't do it.

1119
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,246
It's not your fault.

1120
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,365
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1121
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,247
If you are ready to go home,

1122
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,681
I will be with you.

1123
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,923
Why do you hesitate?

1124
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:55,663

We make it past the barrier islands,

1168
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:34,319
we make it to Te Fiti.

1169

01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,881
No!

1172
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:49,640
Heihei! No, no, no!

1173
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:52,220
Nice work!

1174
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,766
Te Fiti.

1175
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:29,805
Maui!

1176
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,846
You came back.

1177
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,046
But your hook.

1178
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:41,725
One more hit and...

1179
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,244
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

1180
01:25:47,239 --> 01:25:49,042
I got your back, Chosen One.

1181
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,880
Go save the world.

1182
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,068
Maui.

1183
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,680
Thank you.

01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:40,725
it's gone.

01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:55,043
Te Kā!

1193
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,166

1203
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:58,202
I'm sorry about your hook.

1204
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,623
Well, hook, no hook,

1205

I'm Maui.

01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,484
Te Fiti!

1207
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,563
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1208
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,046
Look, what I did was...

1209
01:31:33,399 --> 01:31:34,444
wrong.

1210
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,847
I have no excuse.

1211
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,765
I'm sorry.

1212
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,242
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1213
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:57,127
Thank you.

1214
01:31:57,239 --> 01:31:59,840
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1215
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,085
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1216
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:52,487
You could come with us, you know.

1217
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,806
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1218
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:00,143
They already have one.

1219
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,065
See you out there, Maui.

1220
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,046
See you out there, Moana.

1221
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:17,890
Mom! Dad!

1222
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,201
Moana!

1223
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:31,761
I may have gone a little ways past the reef.

1224
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:34,729
It suits you.

1225
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,688
She's back!

1226
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:37,081
Moana!

1227
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:38,240
Pua!

1228
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,601
Moana!

1229
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:44,845
