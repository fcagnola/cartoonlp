00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,389
<i>Saludos Amigos</i>

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>A fond greeting to you</i>

3
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,396
<i>A warm handshake or two</i>

4
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,399
<i>Good friends always do</i>

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,777
<i>Saludos Amigos</i>

6
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,364
<i>A new day's waiting to start</i>

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>You must meet it
Wake up and greet it</i>

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,829
<i>With a gay song
In your heart</i>

9
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,782
<i>Here's an unusual expedition,</i>

10
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,453
<i>artists, musicians and writers setting out
for a trip through Latin America...</i>

11
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,916
<i>to find new personalities, music
and dances for their cartoon films.</i>

12
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,295
<i>So, "Adios, Hollywood,"
and "Saludos, amigos."</i>

13
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,634
<i>Saludos Amigos</i>

14
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,429
<i>A new day's waiting to start</i>

15
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,140
<i>You must meet it
Wake up and greet it</i>

16
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,185
<i>Three days later,
they glided in to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,</i>

17
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,355
<i>then down to the Argentine,
Buenos Aires...</i>

18
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,947
<i>and out across the Pampas.</i>

19
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,620
<i>At Cordoba, the party divided.</i>

20
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,835
<i>Some flew over the Andes
into Chile.</i>

21
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,337
<i>The others went north
to the Inca country.</i>

22
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,297
<i>Bolivia, Peru
and Lake Titicaca.</i>

23
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,926
<i>Turning away
from the modern cities</i>

24
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,679
<i>to find the descendants
of ancient Inca civilization.</i>

25
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>Eight thousand square miles of water
over two miles above sea level.</i>

26
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>Lake Titicaca has been prominent</i>

27
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,191
<i>in Inca history and folklore
for generations.</i>

28
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,116
<i>Wood is scarce at this altitude,</i>

29
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,161
<i>so the fishermen's boats
are woven of balsa reeds.</i>

30
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,962
<i>There's always plenty of color
and excitement here on market day.</i>

31
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,510
<i>These folks come from miles around,</i>

32
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>to trade their goods
and swap some of the local gossip.</i>

33
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,523
<i>The styles run to bright-colored clothes
and conservative hats.</i>

34
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,443
<i>And a rumble seat for the baby.</i>

35
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,863
<i>Just the kind of material
the artists were after.</i>

36
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,411
<i>Their music is strange and exotic.</i>

37
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,041
<i>Melodies handed down
from their Inca ancestors.</i>

38
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>And walking haystacks
are right in tempo.</i>

39
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,101
<i>These little syncopated burros
bear the heavy burdens here...</i>

40
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,396
<i>because the more dignified llama</i>

41
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,191
<i>will carry just so much
and no more.</i>

42
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,321
<i>When his quota is exceeded,
that haughty aristocrat of the Andes</i>

43
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,157
<i>calmly sits down
and refuses to budge.</i>

44
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,914
<i>Yes, a llama can make you feel
awfully unimportant.</i>

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,764
<i>All these impressions,</i>

46
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,141
<i>together with the local color
that had been absorbed,</i>

47
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,977
<i>resulted in a little travelog,</i>

48
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,271
<i>seeing the land of the Incas,</i>

49
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,274
<i>through the eyes of a celebrated
North American tourist.</i>

50
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,699
<i>Lake Titicaca is approximately
13,000 feet above sea level.</i>

51
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,035
- Thirteen thousand feet?!
<i>- Hm. Approximately.</i>

52
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,956
<i>At this great height, many visitors
are subject to altitude fever</i>

53
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,458
<i>- or</i> soroche.
- Is that so?

54
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,544
<i>The most common symptom
is dizziness.</i>

55
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,962
Dizziness?

56
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,463
Ah, phooey!

57
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,391
<i>Often followed by palpitation
of the heart.</i>

58
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,437
<i>The ears have a tendency to pop.</i>

59
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,567
<i>And a peculiar ringing sound is heard.</i>

60
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,863
<i>Fascinating, isn't it?</i>

61
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,326
<i>The balsa, or basket boat</i>

62
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,704
<i>is constructed entirely
of reeds tightly bound together.</i>

63
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,749
<i>It's built to withstand
the fury of the elements.</i>

64
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>In fact, it seems to be impervious
to practically everything.</i>

65
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,965
<i>Except the inquisitive tourist.</i>

66
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,679
<i>Crossing the lake
is often filled with adventure.</i>

67
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,349
<i>A strong wind
may arise very suddenly.</i>

68
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,395
<i>And then stop suddenly.</i>

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,528
<i>In the village we find
this quaint old bakery,</i>

70
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,573
<i>where the tourist may loaf around
to his heart's content.</i>

71
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,787
<i>For the artist
in search of local color,</i>

72
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,123
<i>the marketplace presents
an excellent picture of village life</i>

73
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,460
<i>as shoppers and merchants
bustle about the public square.</i>

74
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,346
<i>The precipitous terrain
in this region offers no problem</i>

75
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,597
<i>to these hardy folk.</i>

76
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,519
<i>And we find the people here
divided into two classes,</i>

77
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>those who walk against the wind...</i>

78
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,565
<i>and those who walk with the wind.</i>

79
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,907
<i>Yes, wherever the visitor
points his camera,</i>

80
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,534
<i>he finds a picture...</i>

81
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,577
<i>fit for framing.</i>

82
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,747
<i>The llama, or "yama,"
is an odd-looking individual,</i>

83
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,582
<i>with considerable personality.</i>

84
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,420
<i>His master, here, exercises
complete control over him,</i>

85
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,712
<i>with a homemade flute.</i>

86
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,049
<i>Let's see how he responds
to a few notes up scale.</i>

87
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,719
<i>And down scale.</i>

88
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:13,100
<i>Up.</i>

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,228
<i>Down.</i>

90
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,438
<i>Now do a circular pattern.</i>

91
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,943
<i>Or reverse.</i>

92
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,161
My, my, my! It's amazing!

93
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,474
<i>Note how the crude sign language</i>

94
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,975
<i>being used by our tourist here,</i>

95
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,311
<i>is quickly interpreted
by this wide-awake youngster.</i>

96
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,562
<i>¿Aquí está?</i>

97
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,606
<i>¡Gracias!</i>

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,774
<i>¡Mucho gracias!</i>

99
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,112
BI-bl-bl-bl-bl!

100
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,869
<i>The visitor never seems
to be satisfied,</i>

101
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,579
<i>until he tries on the native costume.</i>

102
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,290
<i>And our tourist is no exception.</i>

103
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,570
<i>The llama is obviously
not a jitterbug,</i>

104
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,156
<i>but if you want to explore
this precipitous country,</i>

105
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,408
<i>he'll solve all your
transportation problems.</i>

106
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,712
<i>One soon becomes accustomed
to the low, fleecy clouds,</i>

107
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,674
<i>that steel like silent ghosts
across one's path.</i>

108
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,346
<i>The gentle undulating
gait of the llama</i>

109
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,224
<i>adapts itself very nicely
to the swaying motion</i>

110
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,809
<i>of the suspension bridge.</i>

111
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,811
Suspension bridge?

112
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,064
Oh!

113
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,902
<i>Far below us,
we see the village.</i>

114
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,864
Whoa! Whoa!

115
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,328
The flute.

116
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,344
Give me that flute,
ya big palooka!

117
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,940
Hey! Take it easy!

118
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,817
Whoa! Whoa!

119
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,614
What?

120
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,919
<i>The traveler should
be cautioned against</i>

121
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,672
<i>any reckless behavior
at this high altitude.</i>

122
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>Overexertion is dangerous.</i>

123
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,428
<i>And above all, one should never
lose one's temper.</i>

124
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,805
Shut up, ya' big windbag!

125
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,519
Get off of me! Go on, beat it!

126
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,647
Doggone you.

127
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,580
<i>And finally,
the pottery market,</i>

128
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,833
<i>where the visitor always drops in...</i>

129
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,754
<i>seldom failing to accumulate
a large collection,</i>

130
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,381
<i>of the native handiwork,</i>

131
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,383
<i>as he bids a fond farewell</i>

132
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,719
<i>to the land of the Incas,
Lake Titicaca.</i>

133
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,476
<i>The flight across the Andes
into Chile,</i>

134
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,937
<i>over the highest mountains
in America.</i>

135
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,690
<i>Plenty to see and remember
on this spectacular trip.</i>

136
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>Since no cameras are allowed here,</i>

137
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,904
<i>the boys have to cover this
from memory and sketches.</i>

138
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,537
<i>Impressions of Uspallata Pass
from 16,000 feet.</i>

139
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,792
<i>These sketches and the stories told
of the pioneer mail planes</i>

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,420
<i>that first flew this route
started everyone thinking.</i>

141
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,757
<i>First a little plane
began to take shape...</i>

142
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,846
<i>with a personality all his own.</i>

143
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,767
<i>All agreed that he had
good screen possibilities...</i>

144
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,645
<i>and before the plane
set down at Santiago,</i>

145
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,605
<i>his life story had begun.</i>

146
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,653
<i>Once upon a time, in a little airport</i>

147
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,407
<i>near Santiago, Chile,
there lived three airplanes,</i>

148
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,287
<i>the papa plane, the mama plane
and the baby plane.</i>

149
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,374
<i>The papa plane was a big
powerful male plane.</i>

150
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,673
<i>Mama plane was a middle-sized
female plane.</i>

151
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,386
<i>And the baby plane
was a little boy plane named Pedro.</i>

152
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,305
<i>Uh, where is Pedro?</i>

153
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,766
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

154
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,685
<i>Maybe someday he'll grow up
to be a big plane</i>

155
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,729
<i>like his father
who carries the mail,</i>

156
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,481
<i>between Chile and Argentina.</i>

157
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,154
<i>Like all fledglings,
Pedro went to ground school,</i>

158
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,906
<i>to learn the ABC's of flying.</i>

159
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>He studied reading, skywriting...</i>

160
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,537
<i>and arithmetic.</i>

161
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,790
<i>He was taught anatomy.</i>

162
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,876
<i>He also studied history.</i>

163
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,755
<i>Pedro! And geography.</i>

164
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,674
<i>And in geography,
he learned the mail route</i>

165
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,510
<i>between Santiago and Mendoza.</i>

166
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,514
<i>Over the mighty Andes,
past Aconcagua,</i>

167
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,808
<i>highest mountain
in the western hemisphere.</i>

168
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,022
<i>One day the papa plane was laid up
with a cold in his cylinder head.</i>

169
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,944
<i>So, he couldn't fly the mail.</i>

170
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,280
<i>And the mama plane
couldn't stand the altitude,</i>

171
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,115
<i>because she had high oil pressure.</i>

172
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,076
<i>So, she couldn't fly the mail.</i>

173
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,789
<i>But the mail must go through.</i>

174
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,040
<i>I hope.</i>

175
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,586
<i>Calling Pedro.
Ready for Flight Two to Mendoza.</i>

176
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,965
<i>"Now, remember, Pedro,"
the mama plane said,</i>

177
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,135
<i>"stay out of downdraft
and keep your muffler on tight."</i>

178
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,055
And don't go near Aconca--

179
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,392
Aconca-- Aconcagua!

180
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,397
<i>Flight Two leaving for Mendoza.</i>

181
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,653
<i>All clear, Pedro.
Let 'er go.</i>

182
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,241
<i>Give 'er the gun, boy!</i>

183
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,660
<i>Gun 'er! Gun 'er!</i>

184
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,413
<i>Don't lose your flying speed!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

185
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,999
Look out!

186
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,880
<i>And so after a masterly take off,</i>

187
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,257
<i>Pedro started on his
first assignment,</i>

188
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,301
<i>to pick up the mail at Mendoza.</i>

189
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,390
<i>Each and every trip through this pass
is an adventure in itself.</i>

190
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,852
<i>At this altitude, you never
can tell what--</i>

191
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,520
<i>Downdraft!</i>

192
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,315
<i>Pulled out of that one all right.</i>

193
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,901
<i>Handles himself like a veteran.</i>

194
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,530
<i>His course carried him
over the Pass of Uspallata,</i>

195
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,366
<i>where stands the statue
of the Christ of the Andes,</i>

196
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,369
<i>marking the boundary
between Chile and Argentina.</i>

197
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,623
<i>So far, so good.
Not a cylinder missing.</i>

198
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,835
<i>Pedro was flying on top
of the world when suddenly...</i>

199
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,673
<i>his first view of that
towering monarch, Aconcagua!</i>

200
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,135
<i>So, this was the big bully
they'd warned him about.</i>

201
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,180
<i>But, he didn't scare Pedro, though.</i>

202
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,932
<i>No, siree.</i>

203
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,397
<i>Well, the worst is over.</i>

204
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,609
<i>And from now on,
it's clear sailing to Mendoza.</i>

205
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,945
<i>Come in against the wind, Pedro.</i>

206
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,363
<i>There's your mail.</i>

207
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,156
<i>Easy now.</i>

208
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,741
<i>Atta boy!</i>

209
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,868
<i>He picked up his mail
like a veteran.</i>

210
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,206
<i>Uh-oh! Careful!
That cargo is precious.</i>

211
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,542
<i>Pedro was homeward bound
and ahead of schedule.</i>

212
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,380
<i>I'll bet his mother and dad
will be proud of him.</i>

213
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,383
<i>Just a natural-born flier.</i>

214
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,221
<i>Hmm, maybe I shouldn't
have mentioned it.</i>

215
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,400
<i>Look out!</i>

216
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,944
<i>Hope he got that out of his system.</i>

217
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>Now with good luck and--
Uh-oh.</i>

218
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,993
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>

219
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,287
<i>Hey, Pedro, come back!</i>

220
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,039
<i>The little fellow had completely</i>

221
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,417
<i>forgotten his responsibilities.
Pedro!</i>

222
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,505
<i>Then suddenly, Aconcagua!</i>

223
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:50,760
<i>Its rocky, snow-filled crags formed
the face of a leering monster.</i>

224
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,888
<i>The oil froze
in little Pedro's cylinders</i>

225
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,224
<i>and his motor knocked with fright.</i>

226
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,310
<i>All those warnings
came back to him now,</i>

227
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,814
<i>the treacherous crosscurrents,
the sudden storms.</i>

228
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,772
<i>Climb above the storm,
Pedro!</i>

229
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,775
<i>Never mind the mail!
Let it go! Let it go!</i>

230
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,278
<i>Forget the mail!
Climb, Pedro! Climb!</i>

231
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,533
<i>Look out!</i>

232
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,662
<i>Climb, Pedro! Climb!</i>

233
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,083
<i>Get above the storm!
I know you can make it!</i>

234
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,761
<i>Drop the mail!
You've got to save yourself!</i>

235
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,265
<i>More altitude!
25,000's all you need!</i>

236
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,559
<i>Up! Up!</i>

237
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,645
<i>Gun your motor!</i>

238
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,814
<i>Now, just a little more
and you'll be in the clear!</i>

239
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,818
<i>Climb, Pedro! Climb!
Good boy!</i>

240
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,071
<i>Good boy!
I knew you could make it!</i>

241
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,781
<i>You're all right now.</i>

242
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,450
<i>Just level off and head straight
for home.</i>

243
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,413
<i>He's out of gas.</i>

244
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,751
<i>Pedro! Pedro!</i>

245
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,338
<i>He's gone.</i>

246
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,883
<i>Back at the home field,</i>

247
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,011
<i>Pedro's parents
searched the skies in vain.</i>

248
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,806
<i>They knew that he couldn't
have held out this long.</i>

249
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,559
<i>Their brave little son was gone.</i>

250
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,395
<i>Another martyr to the mail service.</i>

251
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,357
<i>Poor little fella.
His first flight.</i>

252
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,486
<i>It's too bad
it had to end this way.</i>

253
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,864
<i>What was that?</i>

254
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,701
<i>I wonder if it--
No, it couldn't be.</i>

255
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,120
<i>Wait! It is!</i>

256
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,997
<i>It's Pedro!</i>

257
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,046
<i>Pedro! Petey boy! Are you all right?</i>

258
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,758
<i>Well, don't ask me how he did it.</i>

259
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,304
<i>It wasn't exactly
a three-point landing,</i>

260
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,182
<i>but he did fulfill his mission.</i>

261
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,767
<i>He brought the mail through.</i>

262
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,021
<i>The mail, that all-important cargo.</i>

263
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,190
<i>"Estoy divirtiendome."</i>

264
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,776
<i>"Having wonderful time.
Wish you were--" Hmm.</i>

265
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,696
<i>Well, it might have been important.</i>

266
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>And he did bring in the mail!</i>

267
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,161
<i>And so the papa plane,
the mama plane</i>

268
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,914
<i>and little Pedro
flew happily ever after.</i>

269
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,044
<i>Sailing eastward from Chile,
we cross the Argentine Pampas.</i>

270
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,715
<i>Just millions of acres
of rich grazing land...</i>

271
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,092
<i>stretching from the mountains
to Buenos Aires...</i>

272
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,012
<i>the third largest city
in the Western Hemisphere.</i>

273
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,849
<i>Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.</i>

274
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,935
<i>This is the Plaza de Mayo,</i>

275
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,978
<i>one of its delightful parks.</i>

276
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>The Teatro Colon,
home of the opera.</i>

277
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,860
<i>And the stately Congress building,</i>

278
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,403
<i>center of Argentina's government.</i>

279
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,367
<i>The tallest building
in South America...</i>

280
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,827
<i>the Edificio Cavanaugh.</i>

281
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,249
<i>Yes, they were really impressed
with the big city,</i>

282
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,252
<i>but impressive too
was the lure of the Pampas</i>

283
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,753
<i>and the Argentine gaucho,</i>

284
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,172
<i>as painted by F. Molina Campos.</i>

285
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,717
<i>The party were guests
at his ranch studio,</i>

286
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,053
<i>where Senor Campos
paints the gaucho</i>

287
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,930
<i>with amazing detail and humor.</i>

288
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,020
<i>Seeing these pictures made them
more anxious than ever</i>

289
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,814
<i>to meet these</i> caballeros
<i>in person.</i>

290
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>And they lived up to their pictures.</i>

291
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,197
<i>A real wild west show,</i>

292
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,825
<i>but just part of the day's work
for a gaucho.</i>

293
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,204
<i>Sketching these</i> paisanos
<i>in action was no easy job.</i>

294
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,963
<i>But they did manage to get a good
look at the gaucho's equipment.</i>

295
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,092
<i>Silver coins decorate his belt,
or</i> tirador.

296
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,469
<i>The sheepskin saddle.</i>

297
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,014
<i>Soft horsehide boots.</i>

298
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,684
<i>This garment's called a chiripa.</i>

299
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,481
<i>Here the visitors
were treated to an</i> asado:

300
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,026
<i>choice cuts of meat,</i>

301
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,611
mate, <i>the Argentine tea,</i>

302
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,239
<i>and wine from their own vineyards.</i>

303
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,159
<i>True Argentine hospitality.</i>

304
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,245
<i>A group of skilled dancers
entertained the guests.</i>

305
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,290
<i>Not the modern tango
of Buenos Aires,</i>

306
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,001
<i>but the country dances
of the Argentine.</i>

307
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,963
<i>The same tunes to which
their grandparents had danced.</i>

308
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,274
<i>Notice how closely
these steps resemble</i>

309
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,568
<i>the old-time square dances
of North America.</i>

310
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,332
<i>Gathering picture material here
was a pleasure.</i>

311
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,151
<i>Another story was under way.</i>

312
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,612
<i>And after seeing
Senor Campos' paintings,</i>

313
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,280
<i>and all this colorful exhibition,</i>

314
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,158
<i>we couldn't help but compare
the life of the Argentine gaucho,</i>

315
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,910
<i>with that of our own cowboy.</i>

316
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,247
<i>And they reached way back into Texas
to find the leading man.</i>

317
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,750
<i>From the windswept plains
of Montana,</i>

318
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,378
<i>to the sunbaked banks
of the Rio Grande,</i>

319
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,923
<i>over countless miles
of mountain and prairie,</i>

320
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,719
<i>untouched and unsullied
by the mercenary hand of civilization,</i>

321
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,015
<i>roams a tough,
hardy and heroic breed of man,</i>

322
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,143
<i>the North American cowboy.</i>

323
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,438
<i>Strong, silent and weather-beaten.</i>

324
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,067
Howdy, strangers!

325
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,653
<i>This colorful cowhand
of the great west</i>

326
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,573
<i>has his counterpart
in the South American gaucho.</i>

327
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,076
<i>So let us call upon the magic
of our motion picture camera</i>

328
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,121
<i>and whisk our hardy heroes outward.</i>

329
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,831
<i>Over land and sea,</i>

330
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,459
<i>over rugged mountains
and dense jungles...</i>

331
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,462
<i>down across the equator</i>

332
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,798
<i>to the lush, grassy Pampas
of the Argentine,</i>

333
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,758
<i>the home of the gaucho.</i>

334
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,723
<i>Now, the cowboys of both Americas
have much in common,</i>

335
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,851
<i>although their costume differs
in a few minor details.</i>

336
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,105
<i>We substitute</i> bombachas
<i>for chaps, the</i> sombrero.

337
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,773
<i>Then there's the</i> saco,

338
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,943
<i>the</i> tirador, <i>the</i> chiripa
<i>and the</i> panuelo.

339
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,571
Botas, espuelas.

340
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,035
<i>Then finally, we have the</i> poncho,

341
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,579
<i>which just about covers everything.</i>

342
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,710
<i>The gaucho's closest friend
and inseparable companion</i>

343
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,338
<i>is his horse, or</i> pingo.

344
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,677
<i>Quickly the gaucho reaches
for his lasso!</i>

345
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,429
<i>Twirling the rawhide above his head,</i>

346
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>he deftly tosses the noose
about the horse's neck,</i>

347
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,517
<i>and easily subdues
the spirited animal</i>

348
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,602
<i>with the help of the snubbing post...</i>

349
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,938
<i>...or palenque.</i>

350
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,776
<i>Thanks to the palenque,
or snubbing post,</i>

351
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,903
<i>the horse is soon
brought under control,</i>

352
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,571
<i>and is ready for the saddle.</i>

353
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,329
<i>While it appears complex
at first glance,</i>

354
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>the</i> recado, <i>or saddle,
is really simplicity itself.</i>

355
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,296
<i>In saddling the horse,
or</i> pingo,

356
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,550
<i>the gaucho simply lays
a foundation of</i> sudaderos

357
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,844
<i>and</i> rosaderos, <i>adding the</i> cinchas,
bastos, <i>sheepskin, pigskin,</i>

358
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,557
<i>bridle, bit and finally, the gaucho.</i>

359
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,602
<i>When riding the range at night,</i>

360
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,565
<i>the saddle may be quickly
converted into a bed, or</i> catre.

361
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,277
Bed?

362
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,907
<i>One of the gaucho's
favorite sports is the</i> asado,

363
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,909
<i>or Argentine barbecue.</i>

364
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,246
<i>Over an open charcoal fire,</i>

365
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,708
<i>thick, juicy, tender steaks
are prepared.</i>

366
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,002
<i>And,</i> amigos,

367
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,671
<i>it fairly melts in your mouth.</i>

368
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,174
<i>Macanudo!</i>

369
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,512
<i>The gaucho's method
of eating looks quite simple,</i>

370
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,181
<i>yet requires a certain
amount of practice.</i>

371
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,892
<i>The bread and meat
are held in one hand,</i>

372
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,728
<i>the knife in the other.</i>

373
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,063
<i>Note the action of wrist and elbow,</i>

374
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,067
<i>as knife and food synchronize
in deft, graceful rhythm.</i>

375
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:54,322
<i>One, two, bite, cut, chew.</i>

376
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,283
<i>One, two, bite, cut, chew.</i>

377
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,579
<i>Yes, it is this wholesome diet
that build the gaucho's</i>

378
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,956
<i>nerves of steel and muscles of iron.</i>

379
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,711
<i>And now the</i> boleadoras,
<i>or bolas.</i>

380
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,465
<i>The bolas consist of three lead
weights covered with rawhide</i>

381
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,967
<i>and is often used for sport,
such as capturing</i>

382
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,928
<i>that swift-moving bird of the Pampas,
the Argentine ostrich,</i>

383
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,640
<i>or</i> avestruz.

384
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,017
<i>Unlike most members
of the ostrich family,</i>

385
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,437
<i>the</i> avestruz <i>is not equipped
with ornamental tail plumage.</i>

386
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,357
<i>Its slender legs make
excellent targets for the bolas.</i>

387
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,651
Did he say "bolas"?

388
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:33,527
<i>Caramba!</i>

389
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,781
<i>Dashing at breakneck speed,</i>

390
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,784
<i>the gaucho whirls the bolas
round and round, faster and faster,</i>

391
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,243
<i>and then the throw!</i>

392
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,621
<i>Straight and sure it flies,
until it finds its mark.</i>

393
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,874
<i>And the swift bird is captured
and tied all in one operation.</i>

394
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:53,172
<i>And now to fully appreciate
this remarkable feat,</i>

395
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,049
<i>let us study the action,</i>

396
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,635
<i>through the eye
of the slow-motion camera.</i>

397
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,764
<i>Note the grace and beauty,</i>

398
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:05,643
<i>of this light-footed creature
in startled flight.</i>

399
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:11,482
<i>With delicate balance
and clocklike precision of timing,</i>

400
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,111
<i>man and beast moving as one,</i>

401
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,239
<i>display a minimum of waste motion...</i>

402
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,286
<i>as the whirling bolas are unleashed.</i>

403
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,710
<i>Faster and faster!</i>

404
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,087
<i>On and on they spin,
closer and closer!</i>

405
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,463
<i>Here they come! Be careful!</i>

406
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,840
<i>Get out of the way!
Heads up! Watch it!</i>

407
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,050
<i>Look out, look out! Here it comes!
Duck, duck, duck!</i>

408
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,468
<i>Too late! Too late!</i>

409
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,146
<i>And when night--</i>

410
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,939
<i>When night falls,</i>

411
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,150
<i>...the lone gaucho oft times</i>

412
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,278
<i>finds himself far,
far out on the Pampas.</i>

413
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,031
<i>Listen to the melancholy
strains of the</i> triste,

414
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>a sad, romantic ballad.</i>

415
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:11,584
<i>Yo soy la blanca paloma</i>

416
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,587
<i>Que en el cardal</i>

417
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:18,090
<i>De la loma</i>

418
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:31,479
<i>Yo soy-- Yo soy-- Yo soy--
Yo soy-- Yo soy-- Yo--</i>

419
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,356
<i>Yo soy</i>

420
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,318
<i>But the gaucho
is not always sad.</i>

421
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,197
<i>Come, let us dance
to the lively beat of the chacarera,</i>

422
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,240
<i>the dance of the farmer's daughter.</i>

423
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,829
<i>Combining the minuet,</i>

424
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:53,334
<i>the bunny hug,
and a dash of jumping jive.</i>

425
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,670
<i>The Pampas version
of cutting a rug.</i>

426
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,257
<i>And El Malambo,</i>

427
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,553
<i>a solo number in which the dancer
swings out with utter abandon,</i>

428
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,974
<i>often described as perpetual motion
below the equator.</i>

429
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:18,609
<i>El Pala Pala.</i>

430
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,070
Ah-hyuck!

431
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,156
<i>Traditional dance
of the rooster and the hen.</i>

432
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,632
<i>And now, as he sways
to the gentle undulations</i>

433
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,136
<i>of El Malambo, we gently waft
our transplanted cowboy...</i>

434
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,098
<i>back to his prairie homeland.</i>

435
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,184
<i>Here we leave him
with warm and tender memories,</i>

436
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:56,188
<i>of his visit to the gay,
romantic land of the gaucho.</i>

437
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,526
<i>Hasta la vista.
¡Adios, amigos!</i>

438
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,662
<i>And now from the Pampas
to Brazil and Rio de Janeiro,</i>

439
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,415
<i>a city of amazing beauty
and a perfect setting.</i>

440
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,011
<i>One of the best views of the city
is from the top of Sugarloaf,</i>

441
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,556
<i>overlooking Copacabana Beach,
the playground of Rio.</i>

442
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,228
<i>From Corcovado,
the Statue of the Savior looks out</i>

443
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,439
<i>upon these scenes
of active city life.</i>

444
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,944
<i>This is the kind of atmosphere
the artists were after.</i>

445
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,697
<i>The outdoor cafes...</i>

446
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,076
<i>the mosaic sidewalks
that are found all over Rio.</i>

447
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,456
<i>These designs are a tribute
to patience and artistry,</i>

448
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,416
<i>preserving a Brazilian tradition.</i>

449
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,921
<i>Here are some
of the first impressions.</i>

450
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,926
<i>This is what can happen
to a big city,</i>

451
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,261
<i>when a crowd of cartoonists
are turned loose.</i>

452
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,728
<i>Among the sketches
was a promising actor,</i>

453
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,774
<i>Old Papagaio, the parrot featured
in most of Brazil's funny stories.</i>

454
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,613
<i>With the help
of the wardrobe department,</i>

455
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,531
<i>he becomes Joe Carioca.</i>

456
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,827
<i>The music of Brazil, a samba.</i>

457
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,455
<i>Rhythm instruments
like reco reco...</i>

458
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,166
<i>and the</i> cabaca...

459
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,796
<i>all help to beat out
that intricate samba rhythm...</i>

460
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,508
<i>a lively two-step with a bounce.</i>

461
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,680
<i>It's the same rhythm
that captivates the whole city</i>

462
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,306
<i>when carnival time comes around.</i>

463
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,767
Samba!

00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,664
<i>Carnival in Rio...</i>

<i>Singing, dancing and celebrating.</i>

467
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,715
<i>The spirit of the Mardi Gras
and New Year's Eve rolled into one.</i>

468
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,932
<i>Each year hundreds of songs are written</i>

469
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,392
<i>especially for this occasion,</i>

470
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,936
<i>and the dream of every composer</i>

471
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,480
<i>is to have his song chosen
as a Carnival hit.</i>

472
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,567
<i>One number stood out
as a perfect background</i>

473
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,193
<i>for the first Brazilian film.</i>

474
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,698
<i>Its author, Ary Barroso,
