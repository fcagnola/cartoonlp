1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,558
<i>Ichabod and Mr Toad</i>

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,951
<i>Ichabod</i>

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,716
<i>Ichabod and Mr Toad</i>

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,279
<i>Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...</i>

5
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,279
<i>If you chose the most fabulous</i>
<i>character in English literature,</i>

6
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,351
<i>who would it be?</i>

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,357
<i>Robin Hood? King Arthur?</i>

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,679
<i>Becky Sharp?</i>

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,752
<i>Sherlock Holmes?</i>
<i>Oliver Twist, perhaps?</i>

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,877
<i>Any one of them</i>
<i>would be an excellent choice.</i>

11
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,839
<i>But as the most fabulous</i>
<i>character of all, I nominate</i>

12
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,672
<i>a toad.</i>

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,470
<i>J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.</i>
<i>Have you never met him?</i>

14
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,394
<i>You'll find his story</i>
<i>in "The Wind in the Willows".</i>

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,948
<i>Toad was the one disturbing element.</i>

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,794
<i>Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless,</i>
<i>tried everything.</i>

17
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,396
<i>A positive mania for fads,</i>
<i>and he never counted the cost.</i>

18
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,119
<i>He had a host</i>
<i>of fair-weather friends.</i>

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,035
<i>But there were only three</i>
<i>who had his best interests at heart.</i>

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,317
<i>One was a badger. MacBadger.</i>

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,151
<i>And then there was a water rat.</i>

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,677
<i>A bit stuffy, perhaps,</i>
<i>but really a fine fellow. And a mole.</i>

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,752
<i>A gentle creature,</i>
<i>kind and sympathetic.</i>

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,990
<i>They all made their homes in</i>
<i>a quaint community along a riverbank.</i>

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,312
<i>On that particular day,</i>
<i>Mole was in a hurry because...</i>

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,953
<i>... because he was late for tea.</i>

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,953
<i>A regrettable habit, but Rat</i>
<i>had learned to put up with it.</i>

28
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,794
<i>Sorry, says Mole.</i>
<i>Quite alright, says Rat. Two lumps?</i>

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,475
<i>Then, just as</i>
<i>they were getting settled...</i>

30
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,671
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,149
How's everything on the river, sir?

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,553
Dashed quiet, as usual, thank you.

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,958
Mole, listen.

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,070
"Dear Rat: You and Mole
must come to Toad Hall at once."

35
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,469
"Urgent!! A MacBadger."

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,797
<i>Rat was certain Toad</i>
<i>was making trouble again.</i>

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,112
<i>The answer to that lay</i>
<i>just around the bend at Toad Hall,</i>

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,636
<i>the ancestral home</i>
<i>of J Thaddeus himself.</i>

39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,032
<i>This impressive structure</i>
<i>was the finest home on the river.</i>

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,112
<i>The animals</i>
<i>were tremendously proud of it.</i>

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,637
<i>They felt it gave the whole community</i>
<i>an air of respectability.</i>

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,950
<i>To lose Toad Hall was,</i>
<i>of course, unthinkable,</i>

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
<i>and yet it was no secret</i>
<i>that Toad's follies</i>

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,158
<i>had brought him</i>
<i>to the brink of bankruptcy.</i>

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,109
<i>So, MacBadger had volunteered</i>
<i>to put Toad's house in order.</i>

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,632
Smashed fence. Two guineas.

47
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,716
Damage, lamp post. Four pound six.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,715
Destruction of hen house...

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,951
How can a man figure
with all this hubbub?

50
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,193
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!

51
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,231
- I want my money!
- Silence!

52
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,834
You'll get your money in due course.

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,993
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,436
Why did I assume the responsibility
of looking after...

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,912
Didn't I tell you...?

56
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,229
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,311
You've come at last.

58
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,116
<i>Poor MacBadger.</i>
<i>He'd reached the end of his rope.</i>

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,918
<i>As he said himself...</i>

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,594
I'm practically a nervous wreck.

61
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,592
I say! What seems to be the trouble?

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,038
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,678
But he promised us...

64
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,878
Promises? What good are promises
when wild manias take him?

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,718
Now, look, you're his
closest friends, are you not?

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,950
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.

67
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,271
Then you must find Toad
and stop him!

68
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,830
- What's he doing?
- He's got a new mania.

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,790
He's rampaging about the county
in a canary-yellow gypsy cart.

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,077
With a horse named Cyril.

71
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Tally-ho!

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,117
<i>Are we on our way to Nottingham,</i>
<i>to Brittingham, to Buckingham</i>

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,351
<i>Or any hammy hamlet by the sea?</i>
<i>No!</i>

74
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,194
<i>Are we on our way to Devonshire,</i>
<i>to Lancashire or Worcestershire?</i>

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,078
<i>I'm not so sure</i>
<i>We'll have to wait and see</i>

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,948
<i>Are we on our way to Dover?</i>
<i>Or going merrily over</i>

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,679
<i>The jolly old road</i>
<i>that goes to Plymouth Ho?</i>

78
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,150
<i>No! We're merrily, merrily, merrily,</i>
<i>merrily, merrily</i>

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,313
<i>On our way to nowhere</i>
<i>in particular</i>

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,155
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily,</i>
<i>merrily, merrily on our way</i>

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,312
<i>Though the roads are perpendicular</i>

82
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,190
<i>- We're always in a hurry</i>
<i>- We have no time to stall</i>

83
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,191
<i>We've gotta be there</i>
<i>We've gotta be there</i>

84
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,748
<i>But where, we can't recall</i>

85
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,959
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily,</i>
<i>merrily, merrily on our way</i>

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,669
<i>And we may be going to Devonshire,</i>
<i>to Lancashire, to Worcestershire</i>

87
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,432
<i>We're not so sure,</i>
<i>but what do we care?</i>

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,876
<i>We're only sure</i>
<i>we've got to be there</i>

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,635
<i>We're merrily on our way</i>
<i>to nowhere at all</i>

90
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,515
Hello, you fellows!

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,558
You're the very animals
I was coming to see!

92
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,474
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!

93
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,075
The open road,
the dusty highway. Come!

94
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,151
I'll show you the world.

95
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,437
Travel, change, excitement...

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,472
How stupid of me! I want you fellows
to meet my noble steed Cyril.

97
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,755
Aye, that's me.

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,958
A bit of a trotter,
a bit of a rotter.

99
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,110
How do you do, how do you do,
how do you do?

100
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,994
How do you do?

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,830
Say, guv'nor, your friends seem
a bit on the stuffy side.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,117
Toad, we want to have a talk
with you.

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,918
A visit! Splendid!

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,437
This is serious. You must
give up that horse and cart.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,231
Give up my... But my dear Ratty,
this is my career!

106
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,196
- You can't mean...
- I do!

107
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,238
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.

108
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,276
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.

109
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,716
Your reckless behaviour
is giving animals a bad name!

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,553
You're becoming a menace to society.

111
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
At least think of poor MacBadger!

112
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,273
And as for that horse,
no good will come of gadding about

113
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,238
with such a fast
and irresponsible beast!

114
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,790
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.

115
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,238
Stop it! Let me go!
Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,310
It's no use. You'll never
get me to give this up!

117
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,993
Tally-ho! Yikes!

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,155
Look!

119
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,357
Gad! What is it?

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,037
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,717
A motorcar...
Gad! What have I been missing?

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,237
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.

123
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,836
A new mania. Motor mania.

124
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,592
<i>Mania.</i>

125
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,036
<i>That's it. That's what it was.</i>
<i>A positive mania.</i>

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,590
<i>No telling where it would end.</i>
<i>Might linger for months.</i>

127
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,993
<i>And with Toad Hall at stake,</i>
<i>Rat and Mole had no choice.</i>

128
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,672
<i>Only one thing to do.</i>

129
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,470
<i>Lock the poor chap up until</i>
<i>the poison worked out of his system.</i>

130
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,871
Hold him, Moley!

131
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,473
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,516
Simply no use trying.

133
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,555
Let me out! Open up, I say!
Please!

134
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,313
Open the door!

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,393
<i>Playing jailer to one's</i>
<i>dearest friend wasn't pleasant.</i>

136
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,838
<i>In fact, Moley immediately wanted</i>
<i>to call it quits, but Ratty said no.</i>

137
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,036
<i>This time they must be firm.</i>

138
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,390
<i>It wasn't just a matter</i>
<i>of saving Toad from himself.</i>

139
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,837
<i>There was MacBadger to consider,</i>
<i>and Toad Hall and all it stood for.</i>

140
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,798
<i>There was only one thing wrong</i>
<i>with Ratty's cure for motor mania.</i>

141
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,998
<i>It didn't work.</i>
<i>You see, Toad was far too clever.</i>

142
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,835
<i>And, at the moment, completely mad.</i>
<i>He was determined to get a motorcar,</i>

143
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,354
<i>even if he had to beg, borrow or...</i>

144
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,156
Toad arrested! Extra!

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
His Majesty versus
J Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall,

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,119
Riverbank, Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey.

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,758
24th day of August,
set forth in the following brief.

148
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,598
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad,
of stealing a motorcar,

149
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,912
and with it, endangering
sundry subjects of His Majesty,

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,515
- their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown,

151
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,556
proceed with the case.

152
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,872
My lord, I call,
as first Crown witnesses,

153
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,838
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!

154
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,398
Is it true that you had the accused
locked in his own house

155
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,199
because he had threatened
to get a motorcar?

156
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,835
Did you, or did you not,
have him locked up?

157
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,559
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,593
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!

159
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,637
As trustee of the Toad estate,

160
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,917
you knew of the prisoner's mania
for motorcars?

161
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,396
And due to his extravagance,
you cut off his allowance?

162
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,275
Then he was, to the best of your
knowledge, without funds?

163
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,918
That is all! Thank you!

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,198
Gentlemen of the jury,
the Crown rests.

165
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,875
Counsel for the defence
will present his case.

166
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,997
My lord, with the court's indulgence,

167
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,919
I rise prepared
to plead my own defence.

168
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,831
Stop it.

169
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,911
Gentlemen of the jury...

170
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,555
...I call, as my first witness,
Cyril Proudbottom.

171
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,075
Are you acquainted with
the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?

172
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,995
Lord love a duck, yes! He's one of
the jolliest chaps I've run across.

173
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,991
And simply tons of money.

174
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,799
Good fellow? Throws it away.

175
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,633
But he wasn't throwing it away
that day!

176
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,918
You heard Mr MacBadger testify
that his allowance was cut off.

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Then how did he get a motorcar?

178
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,154
The only way
a gentleman gets anything.

179
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,994
- The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?

180
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,836
I thought you wouldn't know!

181
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,951
Your Lordship, I...

182
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,157
The witness may testify
in his own words.

183
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,279
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts.

184
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,036
When Toady escaped from his boudoir
he headed straight for my place.

185
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,269
<i>Soon we was off down the highway,</i>

186
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,514
<i>but we hadn't gone far, I confess,</i>
<i>when, with a rush and a roar...</i>

187
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,678
<i>... something passed</i>
<i>like the London Express.</i>

188
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,229
<i>It was big, it was red,</i>
<i>it was beautiful.</i>

189
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,313
<i>A motorcar, a bit of alright.</i>

190
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,795
<i>Toady was transfixed</i>
<i>with... rapture.</i>

191
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,675
<i>You could tell</i>
<i>it was love at first sight.</i>

192
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,870
<i>The motor pulled up to a tavern,</i>
<i>wherein was located a bar.</i>

193
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,635
<i>And we watched</i>
<i>while some tough-looking weasels</i>

194
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,188
<i>got out of that lovely red car.</i>

195
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,994
<i>Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.</i>

196
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,958
<i>And not to be trusted, at all.</i>

197
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,873
<i>But how could I know</i>
<i>they'd stolen that car?</i>

198
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,599
<i>I didn't have no crystal ball.</i>

199
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,550
<i>The guv'nor is not one to dally.</i>

200
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,235
<i>He made up his mind like a flash.</i>
<i>He says...</i>

201
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,629
<i>Try it for size, my good Cyril,</i>

202
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,632
<i>while I see</i>
<i>what they'll take for it, cash.</i>

203
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,956
<i>Into the tavern he saunters, where</i>
<i>the barman was back of the bar.</i>

204
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,950
<i>And he said,</i>

205
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,353
Cheerio, tavern keeper. Who's the
owner of that... hot-looking car?

206
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,876
<i>The barman, a codger named Winky,</i>
<i>leaned over the bar and said,</i>

207
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,793
- Why?
<i>- The guv'nor answered,</i>

208
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,359
That car must be mine!

209
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,353
Whatever the price is, I'll buy.

210
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,913
<i>But Toad found he hadn't no money.</i>
<i>So, he promptly offered a trade.</i>

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,949
<i>The weasels appeared to be willing.</i>
<i>In a moment, the bargain was made.</i>

212
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,759
<i>Toady drawed up a paper,</i>
<i>with almost incredible speed.</i>

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,594
<i>He called</i>
<i>on old Winky the barman</i>

214
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,558
<i>to... pop over and witness the deed.</i>

215
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,278
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.

216
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,191
The weasels
gave him the red motorcar,

217
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,190
and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.

218
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,514
Traded Toad Hall? An estate
worth �100,000 for a motorcar?

219
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,917
You expect me to believe that?

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,276
I don't expect you
to believe anything.

221
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,957
Fortunately, I can produce a witness.
Call Mr Winky!

222
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,869
My lord, gentlemen,

223
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,638
facing you in the witness box is a
citizen of substance and standing.

224
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,951
A man of unimpeachable honesty.

225
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,233
Now, Mr Winky, do you recall
an incident that took place

226
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,029
in your... establishment
last August 12th,

227
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,475
that I was a party to?

228
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,677
Yes, sir, that I do.

229
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,316
Well, then... just tell the court
what actually happened.

230
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,870
Well, guv'nor,

231
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,839
you tried to sell me
a stolen motorcar.

232
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,069
That's a deliberate lie,
you monkey-faced rum pot!

233
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,154
I've been framed! Let me go! Help!

234
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,717
Toad guilty!

235
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,755
<i>Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.</i>

236
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,310
<i>The court was determined</i>
<i>to make an example of him.</i>

237
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,188
<i>Toad's friends tried to help him,</i>
<i>but were always blocked.</i>

238
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,511
<i>They must've reopened the case</i>
<i>a dozen times.</i>

239
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,276
<i>Appeals to this court, that court</i>
<i>any court. But the decision stood.</i>

240
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,512
<i>The case of J Thaddeus Toad</i>
<i>was closed.</i>

241
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,998
<i>Merry, merry Christmas time</i>

242
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,757
<i>Bind every heart with happiness</i>
<i>Let everyone...</i>

243
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,799
<i>Yes, once again,</i>
<i>it was a white Christmas.</i>

244
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,351
<i>Melodies of Yuletide hung sweet</i>
<i>upon the winter's air.</i>

245
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,113
<i>Hearts were gay and spirits high.</i>

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,872
<i>Indeed, in all the city,</i>

247
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,192
<i>only one spot was untouched</i>
<i>by the warmth of Christmas cheer.</i>

248
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,469
<i>The Tower, grim monument to</i>
<i>despair. Cold, cruel, forbidding,</i>

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,190
<i>and the abode of Toad for a good</i>
<i>many Christmases to come.</i>

250
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,352
<i>Poor Toad. Alone with memories</i>
<i>of his wasted life.</i>

251
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,193
<i>What a fool he'd been!</i>

252
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,114
<i>With many a pang he recalled</i>
<i>the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,</i>

253
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,714
<i>and his sage advice,</i>
<i>so often scorned.</i>

254
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,590
<i>A tear for Moley, too, for his</i>
<i>loyalty, sympathy, understanding.</i>

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,269
<i>Toad wept for Rat, and all those</i>
<i>little lectures so often laughed at.</i>

256
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,276
<i>Yes, within the dark confines</i>
<i>of his miserable cell,</i>

257
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,957
<i>a new Toad was born.</i>
<i>A reformed Toad, a repentant Toad.</i>

258
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,072
<i>In a flood of remorse,</i>
<i>he vowed to forsake the follies</i>

259
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,878
<i>of the Primrose path.</i>

260
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,397
<i>Never again would he give way</i>
<i>to those mad, foolish manias</i>

261
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,234
<i>that had brought him</i>
<i>to this sorry end.</i>

262
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,793
As it's Christmas,
you're allowed a visitor.

263
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,713
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?

264
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,473
Merry Christmas, sonny!

265
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,235
Granny wouldn't forget
her little Toady boy!

266
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,710
Look, Christmas gift.

267
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,915
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?

268
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,911
A disguise.

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,028
All you've got to do is put on this
natty little costume and...

270
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,875
<i>Alas for good intentions.</i>
<i>Toad was incurable.</i>

271
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,475
<i>One whispered word</i>
<i>and all his high resolve</i>

272
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,711
<i>vanished in the mad whirl</i>
<i>of this new adventure.</i>

273
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,995
<i>This new mania! Escape!</i>

274
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,911
Toad's escaped!

275
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,238
Halt!

276
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,278
Good evening, ma'am.

277
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,316
Good evening to you, Officer.

278
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,194
<i>We're merrily, merrily, merrily...</i>

279
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
Begging your pardon, but you...

280
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,111
You fellows, do you see him?

281
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,994
<i>Gad, what perfectly ripping luck!</i>

282
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,957
<i>Trap Toad, would they?</i>

283
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,191
<i>Never!</i>

284
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,678
- There he goes!
- Where?

285
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,875
Over there!

286
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,910
<i>Blockheads!</i>
<i>Let them scour the countryside.</i>

287
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,312
<i>Once more, J Thaddeus Toad</i>
<i>had the last laugh.</i>

288
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,314
<i>That Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>along the riverbank,</i>

289
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,551
<i>the name of Toad was banned</i>
<i>from conversation,</i>

290
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,236
<i>lest the memory of his disgrace</i>
<i>becloud the merriment of the season.</i>

291
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,359
<i>Yet there was one home, at least,</i>
<i>in which two loyal hearts</i>

292
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,035
<i>still held the warmth</i>
<i>of Christian charity.</i>

293
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,433
Bless this good food
we are about to enjoy.

294
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,876
Bless us, every one.

295
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,989
And... bless poor Toad.

296
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,388
And may he get time off
for good behaviour.

297
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,755
Why, it's a poor old lady.

298
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,959
Let's take her over by the fire.

299
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,909
What are you doing here?

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,514
I was just sort of...

301
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,398
Well, this is a merry Christmas!

302
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,075
But... aren't you afraid
of the police?

303
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,071
Afraid of the police?

304
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,160
I, Toad, afraid of the police?

305
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,472
- Open up, I say!
- The police!

306
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,510
Hide me, Ratty!

307
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,559
Sorry, but you owe a debt to society.

308
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,108
And you've got to pay.

309
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,634
Mole, let them in.

310
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,955
But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe...

311
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,359
Open the door!

312
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,992
Hi, lads!

313
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,710
I've just made
a very important discovery.

314
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,476
<i>Toad Hall is ablaze with lights</i>

315
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,029
<i>and in possession</i>
<i>of a pack of weasels.</i>

316
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,151
<i>And the leader of the gang</i>
<i>is none other than Mr...</i>

317
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,638
Winky!

318
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,478
Hip, hip...

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,431
Hooray!

320
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,036
And so, you see,
he did trade Toad Hall

321
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,031
for the motorcar!

322
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,399
- Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.

323
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,430
And if he were only here right now...

324
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,356
- Toad!
- Angus!

325
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,597
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.

326
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,356
I hope, someday,
you'll find it in your heart...

327
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,478
Not another word.

328
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,235
To err is human, to forgive...

329
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,356
Not so fast!

330
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,876
You're still guilty
in the eyes of the law.

331
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,909
To prove your innocence, we've got
to get that paper away from Winky!

332
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,194
Now, I have a plan.

333
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,999
We'll sneak in
through the secret tunnel.

334
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,553
<i>It was an expert plan, cunningly</i>
<i>contrived but extremely dangerous.</i>

335
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,350
<i>It would work only if each did his</i>
<i>part. There was no margin for error.</i>

336
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,991
<i>The odds against them were</i>
<i>tremendous, but the stakes were high.</i>

337
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,149
<i>But now, steady's the word...</i>

338
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,439
<i>One false move</i>
<i>and four lives hang in the balance.</i>

339
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,595
Careful, lads. There is a guard.

340
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,277
- I'll pop him off!
- Don't shoot!

341
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,556
Who goes there?

342
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,591
<i>That was a close one.</i>

343
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,798
<i>Trust Toad to start things off</i>
<i>on the wrong foot.</i>

344
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,589
<i>No turning back now.</i>
<i>Nothing for it but to push on.</i>

345
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,355
<i>What new and greater perils</i>
<i>lay ahead, no one could say.</i>

346
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,797
<i>Toad had already got out of hand,</i>
<i>so anything could happen.</i>

347
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,951
Look. They're all asleep.

348
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,558
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.

349
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,478
But where is Winky?

350
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,198
There he is!

351
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,794
He's got the paper on him!

352
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,077
We'll have
to climb up on the balcony.

353
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,716
The paper! It's gone!

354
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,514
Get him, you blokes!

355
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,151
I beg your pardon!

356
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,037
Over here!

357
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,315
After it!

358
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,189
- Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!

359
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,591
Where's Moley?

360
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,790
Well, laddies, we saved our skins,
but we didn't get the deed.

361
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,278
Well done!

362
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,079
Hip, hip, hooray!

363
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,078
<i>So, it was a happy ending, after all.</i>

364
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,153
<i>Toad's friends were dreadfully proud</i>
<i>of him. And why not?</i>

365
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,879
<i>He was a new Toad,</i>
<i>completely reformed,</i>

366
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,236
<i>through with gypsy carts</i>
<i>and motorcars for ever.</i>

367
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,359
<i>And so, on this happiest of</i>
<i>New Years, a toast was in order.</i>

368
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,877
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!

369
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,789
Hello, you fellows!

370
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,473
Come! I'll show you the world.

371
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,870
Travel, change, excitement...

372
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,800
<i>That was the fabulous</i>
<i>Thaddeus Toad.</i>

373
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,792
<i>But let's weigh</i>
<i>ourjudgement carefully,</i>

374
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,192
<i>we Moles and Rats and Badgers.</i>
<i>Don't we envy him a bit?</i>

375
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,998
<i>I know I do.</i>

376
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,674
<i>When we speak</i>
<i>of fabulous characters,</i>

377
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,036
<i>the most fabulous will always be,</i>
<i>to me,</i>

378
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,793
<i>the master of Toad Hall.</i>

379
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,713
<i>Yes! J Thad was quite a lad!</i>

380
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,075
<i>Speaking of fabulous characters,</i>

381
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,549
<i>England has produced</i>
<i>a bumper crop.</i>

382
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,235
<i>But here in the colonies,</i>
<i>we have a few of our own.</i>

383
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,389
<i>Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,</i>
<i>Johnny Appleseed, Black Bart,</i>

384
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,357
<i>Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.</i>

385
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,637
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>the one and only Ichabod Crane.</i>

386
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,316
<i>Ichy was the country schoolmaster</i>
<i>dreamed up by Washington Irving.</i>

387
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,117
<i>He had a way with a yarn</i>
<i>did Mr Irving.</i>

388
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,519
<i>If we could journey back</i>
<i>to that period in history</i>

389
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,068
<i>when Manhattan</i>
<i>was but a market town,</i>

390
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,833
<i>we would discover,</i>
<i>in one of the coves</i>

391
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,718
<i>which indent the shores</i>
<i>of the Hudson,</i>

392
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,314
<i>the little village of Tarry Town.</i>

393
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,757
<i>And just beyond, nestled deep</i>
<i>in the low rolling hills,</i>

394
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,831
<i>a sequestered glen.</i>

395
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,869
<i>It's a quiet, peaceful place,</i>
<i>and yet, somehow... foreboding.</i>

396
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,951
<i>It abounds in haunted spots,</i>

397
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,077
<i>twilight tales</i>
<i>and local superstitions.</i>

398
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,753
<i>The best-known story concerns</i>
<i>an itinerant schoolmaster</i>

399
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,400
<i>who once frequented these parts.</i>

400
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,792
<i>Some say his melancholy spirit</i>
<i>still haunts the vicinity.</i>

401
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,918
<i>The pedagogue was described</i>
<i>as a most unusual man.</i>

402
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,877
<i>To see him striding along,</i>

403
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,192
<i>one might mistake him for a</i>
<i>scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.</i>

404
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,958
<i>He was tall, but exceedingly lank.</i>

405
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,153
<i>His head was small and flat on top,</i>
<i>with a long, snipe nose.</i>

406
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,518
<i>It looked like a weathercock</i>
<i>perched upon his spindle neck.</i>

407
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,628
<i>Altogether, he was an apparition</i>
<i>seldom to be seen in broad daylight.</i>

408
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,188
<i>Late one drowsy autumn afternoon,</i>

409
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,229
<i>this strange figure</i>
<i>first approached Sleepy Hollow.</i>

410
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,871
<i>As usual, there had gathered</i>

411
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,633
<i>at Ye Olde Schnooker</i>
<i>and Schnapps Shoppe</i>

412
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,837
<i>a group of rustic lads,</i>
<i>the Sleepy Hollow boys.</i>

413
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,077
<i>Their self-appointed leader,</i>
<i>Brom Bones,</i>

414
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,995
<i>was a burly, roistering blade,</i>
<i>always ready for a fight or a frolic.</i>

415
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,072
<i>Though Brom was given</i>
<i>to madcap pranks and practical jokes,</i>

416
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,799
<i>there was no malice in his mischief.</i>

417
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,270
<i>With his waggish humour</i>
<i>and prodigious strength,</i>

418
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,955
<i>Brom Bones was quite the hero,</i>
<i>all the country round.</i>

419
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,757
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!

420
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,160
Look at that old spook of spooks.

421
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,558
<i>Who's that coming down the street?</i>

422
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,313
<i>Are they shovels or are they feet?</i>

423
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,552
<i>Lean and lanky</i>

424
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,153
<i>Skin and bone</i>

425
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,312
<i>With clothes a scarecrow</i>
<i>would hate to own</i>

426
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,233
<i>Yet, he has a certain air</i>

427
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,118
<i>Debonair and devil-may-care</i>

428
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,872
<i>It's the new schoolmaster</i>

429
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,279
<i>What's his name?</i>

430
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,873
<i>Ichabod</i>

431
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,473
<i>Ichabod Crane</i>

432
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,349
<i>What a name!</i>

433
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,919
<i>Kind of odd</i>

434
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,877
<i>But nice just the same</i>

435
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,754
<i>Funny pan, funny frame</i>

436
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,037
<i>Ichabod may be quaint</i>

437
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,351
<i>May be odd, and maybe he ain't</i>

438
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,193
<i>Anyway, there's no complaint</i>

439
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,669
<i>From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...</i>

440
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,869
<i>Though the arrival of the pedagogue</i>
<i>gave rise to mixed emotions,</i>

441
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,794
<i>the townspeople all agreed</i>
<i>they'd never seen anyone...</i>

442
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,235
<i>Like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane</i>

443
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,318
<i>The schoolroom</i>
<i>became Ichabod's empire,</i>

444
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,598
<i>over which, with lordly dignity,</i>
<i>he held absolute sway.</i>

445
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>Truth to say, Ichabod</i>
<i>was a conscientious man,</i>

446
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,630
<i>and ever bore in mind the maxim</i>
<i>spare the rod and spoil the child.</i>

447
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,794
<i>Still, he was careful</i>
<i>to administerjustice</i>

448
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,791
<i>with discrimination.</i>

449
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,509
<i>For it behoved him to keep</i>
<i>on good terms with his pupils.</i>

450
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,559
<i>Especially if their mothers</i>
<i>happened to be good cooks.</i>

451
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,877
<i>Who's the town's ladies' man?</i>

452
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,793
<i>Gets around like nobody can</i>

453
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,633
<i>Has to be none other than...</i>

454
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,116
<i>As time went by,</i>
<i>it may be seen that the pedagogue</i>

455
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,555
<i>got on tolerably enough.</i>

456
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,589
<i>Moreover, Ichabod found ways</i>
<i>to increase his slender income</i>

457
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,511
<i>and, at the same time,</i>

458
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,071
<i>awaken the cultural interests</i>
<i>of the sleepy little village.</i>

459
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,078
<i>It was inevitable</i>
<i>that a man like Ichabod</i>

460
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,153
<i>would become an object of ridicule</i>
<i>to Brom Bones and his gang.</i>

461
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,755
<i>Yet, to Ichabod,</i>
<i>these were small matters.</i>

462
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,718
<i>He possessed</i>
<i>a remarkable equanimity</i>

463
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,917
<i>which remained</i>
<i>quite undisturbed until</i>

464
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,879
<i>that fateful day, when his path</i>
<i>was crossed by a woman.</i>

465
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,276
<i>A certain woman.</i>

466
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,514
<i>Katrina Van Tassel,</i>
<i>only child of Baltus Van Tassel,</i>

467
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,034
<i>the richest farmer in the county.</i>

468
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,874
<i>She was a blooming lass,</i>
<i>plump as a partridge.</i>

469
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,839
<i>Ripe, melting and rosy-cheeked.</i>

470
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,236
<i>Once you have met</i>
<i>that little coquette Katrina</i>

471
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,471
<i>You won't forget Katrina</i>

472
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,351
<i>But nobody yet</i>
<i>has ever upset Katrina</i>

473
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,036
<i>That cute coquette Katrina</i>

474
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,598
<i>You can do more</i>
<i>with Margaret or Helena</i>

475
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,351
<i>Or Anne or Angelina</i>

476
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,079
<i>But Katrina will kiss and run</i>

477
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,789
<i>To her, a romance is fun</i>

478
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,871
<i>With always another one to start</i>

479
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,399
<i>And yet when you've met</i>
<i>that little coquette Katrina</i>

480
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,750
<i>You've lost your heart</i>

481
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,468
<i>There was no doubt the fair Katrina</i>

482
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,711
<i>was the richest prize</i>
<i>in the countryside.</i>

483
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,678
<i>The schoolmaster,</i>
<i>being an ambitious man,</i>

484
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,070
<i>began to fill his mind</i>
<i>with many sugared thoughts</i>

485
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,515
<i>and hopeful suppositions.</i>

486
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,229
<i>Katrina, my love.</i>

487
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,115
<i>Who can resist your grace?</i>
<i>Your charm?</i>

488
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,189
<i>And who can resist</i>
<i>your father's farm?</i>

489
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,312
<i>Boy, what a set-up!</i>

490
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,915
<i>There's gold in them acres,</i>
<i>and that ain't hay.</i>

491
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,994
<i>Not to mention</i>
<i>that lovely green stuff.</i>

492
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,238
<i>Katrina, my sweet. My treasure.</i>

493
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,992
<i>Treasure...</i>

494
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,596
<i>That barn's a gold mine.</i>

495
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,638
<i>How I'd love to hit the jackpot.</i>

496
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,069
<i>Dear Katrina. Papa's only child.</i>

497
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,518
<i>Papa!</i>

498
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,955
<i>The old goat can't take it with him.</i>

499
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,350
<i>When he cuts out,</i>
<i>that's where I cut in.</i>

500
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,191
<i>Sweet Katrina, poor little rich girl.</i>

501
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,714
<i>But don't worry, Katie,</i>
<i>Ichabod will protect you.</i>

502
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,670
<i>Yes, Katrina, you've won me.</i>

503
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,277
<i>I surrender.</i>

504
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,316
<i>And yet when you've met</i>
<i>that little coquette Katrina</i>

505
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,350
<i>You've lost your heart</i>

506
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,029
<i>Every portal to Katrina's heart</i>
<i>was jealously guarded</i>

507
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,680
<i>by a host of rustic admirers.</i>

508
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,116
<i>But Ichabod was confident</i>
<i>he'd soon ride roughshod</i>

509
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,714
<i>over these simple country bumpkins.</i>

510
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,356
<i>But the most formidable obstacle</i>
<i>he had failed to reckon with.</i>

511
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,671
<i>That was the redoubtable</i>
<i>Brom Bones.</i>

512
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,550
<i>The ease with which Brom</i>
<i>cleared the field of rivals</i>

513
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,837
<i>both piqued and provoked</i>
<i>the fair Katrina.</i>

514
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,557
<i>She often wished that</i>
<i>some champion would appear</i>

515
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,394
<i>and take the field openly</i>
<i>against the boisterous Brom.</i>

516
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,597
<i>A wiser man would have shrunk</i>
<i>from the competition,</i>

517
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,749
<i>but love is blind.</i>

518
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,513
<i>Ichabod was aware</i>
<i>only that Dame Fortune</i>

519
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,114
<i>was at last thundering at his door.</i>

520
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,915
<i>It's true that Brom liked a joke</i>
<i>as well as the next,</i>

521
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,036
<i>but enough was too much.</i>

522
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,274
<i>It was time for open warfare.</i>

523
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,669
<i>He'd double that schoolmaster up</i>

524
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,638
<i>and lay him on a shelf</i>
<i>in his schoolhouse!</i>

525
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,237
<i>But this was easier said than done.</i>

526
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,478
<i>No doubt of it,</i>
<i>this was Ichabod's lucky day.</i>

527
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,036
<i>The schoolmaster</i>
<i>was a man of hidden talents,</i>

528
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,190
<i>a rival to be reckoned with.</i>

529
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,077
<i>Still, wars are neither won nor lost</i>
<i>at the first encounter.</i>

530
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,277
<i>The high-flyer</i>
<i>might yet be brought to earth.</i>

531
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,670
<i>For Brom Bones</i>
<i>was never a man to cry quits.</i>

532
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,714
<i>On the occasion of her father's</i>
<i>annual Halloween frolic,</i>

533
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,873
<i>Katrina chose to stir the embers</i>
<i>of the smouldering rivalry.</i>

534
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,715
<i>One invitation in particular</i>
<i>carried a most personal summons.</i>

535
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,953
<i>The worthy schoolmaster</i>
<i>was in a transport ofjoy.</i>

536
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,713
<i>To him,</i>
<i>this could mean but one thing.</i>

537
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,354
<i>Ichy, you sly old dog, you!</i>

538
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,591
<i>What is this strange power</i>
<i>you have over women?</i>

539
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,640
<i>Well, tonight's the night, boy!</i>

540
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,430
<i>Just turn on the old charm.</i>

541
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,751
<i>The fair Katrina</i>
<i>is yours for the asking.</i>

542
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,191
<i>Gaily bedecked and nobly mounted</i>
<i>on a horse he had borrowed,</i>

543
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,511
<i>Ichabod issued forth</i>
<i>like a knight errant of old</i>

544
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,909
<i>to keep a tryst with his lady fair.</i>

545
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,869
<i>There was nothing to equal</i>
<i>the merrymaking</i>

546
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,428
<i>at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.</i>

547
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,718
<i>To Ichabod, here was</i>
<i>a perfect field for his endeavours.</i>

548
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,917
<i>How would he put</i>
<i>his best foot forward!</i>

549
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,755
<i>Beyond all his other talents,</i>
<i>he prided himself upon his dancing.</i>

550
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,634
<i>Unhappy Brom,</i>
<i>already bested at every turn,</i>

551
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,473
<i>saw himself once more outmatched.</i>

552
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,878
<i>For as he watched</i>
<i>the posturing pedagogue,</i>

553
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,430
<i>he had to admit</i>
<i>that here was a flawless picture</i>

554
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,795
<i>of ease and grace.</i>

555
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,115
<i>There was no doubt that Ichabod</i>
<i>was the man of the hour.</i>

556
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,636
<i>Brom had to concede his rival</i>
<i>another victory.</i>

557
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,315
<i>Yet, there was still</i>
<i>a chance his time would come.</i>

558
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,757
<i>For when the hour grew late, Van</i>
<i>Tassel would call on his guests</i>

559
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,752
<i>to tell him ghostly tales</i>
<i>of Halloween.</i>

560
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,957
<i>Brom knew there was</i>
<i>no more potent believer</i>

561
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,318
<i>in spooks and goblins</i>
<i>than Ichabod Crane.</i>

562
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,560
Just gather round and I'll elucidate

563
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,438
what goes on outside,
when it gets late.

564
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,910
Around about midnight,
the ghosts and banshees

565
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,514
get together for nightly jamborees.

566
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,068
Things with horns and saucer eyes,

567
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,277
and some with fangs about this size!

568
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,828
- Some are fat.
- And some are thin!

569
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,718
And some don't even wear their skin!

570
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,156
I'm telling you, brother,
it's a frightful sight

571
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,196
what goes on, Halloween night.

572
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,236
<i>When spooks</i>
<i>have a midnight jamboree</i>

573
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,039
<i>They break it up with fiendish glee</i>

574
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,953
<i>Ghosts are bad,</i>
<i>but the one that's cursed</i>

575
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,077
<i>Is the Headless Horseman,</i>
<i>he's the worst</i>

576
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,118
<i>That's right,</i>
<i>he's a fright on Halloween night</i>

577
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,510
<i>When he goes a-joggin'</i>
<i>across the land</i>

578
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,319
<i>Holdin' his noggin in his hand</i>

579
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,198
<i>Demons take one look and groan</i>

580
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,078
<i>And hit the road for parts unknown</i>

581
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,993
<i>Beware, take care, he rides alone</i>

582
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,117
<i>And there's no spook</i>
<i>like a spook who's spurned</i>

583
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,953
<i>They don't like him</i>
<i>and he's really burned</i>

584
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,112
<i>He swears</i>
<i>to the longest day he's dead</i>

585
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,397
<i>He'll show them</i>
<i>that he can get ahead</i>

586
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,069
<i>They say he's tired</i>
<i>of his flamin' top</i>

587
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,310
<i>He's got a yen to make a swap</i>

588
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,553
<i>So he rides one night each year</i>

589
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,473
<i>To find a head in the hollow here</i>

590
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,552
<i>Now, he likes them little,</i>
<i>he likes them big</i>

591
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,713
<i>Part in the middle, or a wig</i>

592
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,473
<i>Black or white, or even red</i>

593
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,393
<i>The Headless Horseman</i>
<i>needs a head</i>

594
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,438
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

595
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,353
<i>He's out lookin' for a top to chop</i>

596
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,477
<i>So don't stop to figure out a plan</i>

597
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,951
<i>You can't reason</i>
<i>with a headless man</i>

598
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,119
Now, if you doubt this tale is so,

599
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,353
I met that spook just a year ago.

600
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,749
Now, I didn't stop
for a second look,

601
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,157
but made for the bridge
that spans the brook.

602
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,959
For once you cross that bridge,
my friends

603
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,634
<i>The ghost is through,</i>
<i>his power ends</i>

604
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,598
<i>So, when you're riding home tonight</i>

605
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,478
<i>Make for the bridge</i>
<i>with all your might</i>

606
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,233
<i>He'll be down in the hollow there</i>

607
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,639
<i>He needs your head</i>

608
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,233
<i>Look out! Beware!</i>

609
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,959
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

610
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,998
<i>He's out lookin' for a head to swap</i>

611
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,878
<i>So don't try to figure out a plan</i>

612
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,239
<i>You can't reason</i>
<i>with a headless man</i>

613
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,955
<i>It was the witching hour of night</i>
<i>as Ichabod pursued his travel home.</i>

614
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,953
<i>The sky grew darker.</i>

615
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,316
<i>One by one,</i>
<i>the stars winked out their lights.</i>

616
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,995
<i>Driving clouds</i>
<i>obscured the moon from sight.</i>

617
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,959
<i>Never had the schoolmaster</i>
<i>felt so melancholy,</i>

618
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,429
<i>so utterly alone.</i>

619
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,318
<i>The nearer he approached</i>
<i>the hollow,</i>

620
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,595
<i>the more dismal he became.</i>

621
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,672
<i>Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's</i>
<i>anxiety increased one-hundredfold.</i>

622
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,230
<i>The forest seemed</i>
<i>to close in behind him.</i>

623
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,790
<i>Every small detail</i>
<i>of Brom's awful story</i>

624
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,838
<i>returned to haunt his recollection.</i>

625
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,078
Headless Horseman.

626
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,073
Beware!

627
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,114
<i>Once you cross that bridge,</i>
<i>my friends,</i>

628
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,670
<i>the ghost is through,</i>
<i>his power ends.</i>

629
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,070
<i>Next morning,</i>
<i>Ichabod's hat was found.</i>

630
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,036
<i>And close beside it,</i>
<i>a shattered pumpkin.</i>

631
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,076
<i>But there was no trace</i>
<i>of the schoolmaster.</i>

632
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,870
<i>Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones</i>
<i>led the fair Katrina to the altar.</i>

633
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,437
<i>Rumours persisted</i>
<i>that Ichabod was still alive,</i>

634
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,557
<i>married to a wealthy widow</i>
<i>in a distant county.</i>

635
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,318
<i>But the good Dutch settlers</i>
<i>refused to believe such nonsense.</i>

636
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,836
<i>They knew the schoolmaster</i>
<i>had been spirited away</i>

637
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,831
<i>by the Headless Horseman.</i>

638
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,033
<i>With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop</i>

639
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,793
<i>He's out looking for a head to swap</i>

640
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,838
<i>But don't try to figure out a plan</i>

641
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:02,917
<i>You can't reason with a headless man</i>

642
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,991
<i>Man, I'm getting out of here!</i>
