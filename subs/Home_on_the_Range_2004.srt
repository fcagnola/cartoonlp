00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,501
Hyah!

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,671
<i>Out in the land</i>

3
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,238
<i>Where the men
are tough as cactus</i>

4
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>Out in the land where
the wild, wild west was won</i>

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,615
Uhh! Ahh...

6
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,518
<i>Out in the land
of the desperado</i>

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,420
<i>If you're soft
as an avocado</i>

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,425
<i>Yee-haw!
You're guacamole, son</i>

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,689
<i>Oh, home,
this ain't it, pal</i>

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,457
<i>Home, home,
home on the range</i>

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,488
<i>Home, home,
better go git, pal</i>

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>You ain't
home on the range</i>

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,868
<i>Out in the land where
the weak are target practice</i>

14
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,872
<i>Out in the land where
they shoot the mild and meek</i>

15
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,170
Ooh! Aah!

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,506
<i>Out where the bad
are a whole lot badder</i>

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,512
<i>If you're the type
with a nervous bladder</i>

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,845
<i>Yip! Yow!
Your saddle's gonna reek</i>

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,351
<i>'Cause you ain't
home on the range</i>

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,717
<i>Cowboy,
you're really up a creek</i>

21
00:00:54,754 --> 00:01:00,287
<i>Home, home,
home on the range</i>

22
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,351
Howdy, sheriff!

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,728
<i>Home on the range.</i>

25
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>Once upon a time,
I had a home on the range.</i>

26
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,642
<i>But not anymore.</i>

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,480
<i>Well, it's no use
cryin' over spilled milk.</i>

28
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,985
<i>Speakin' of which, that's me.</i>

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,419
<i>I'm the cow.</i>

30
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,089
<i>Yeah, they're real.</i>

31
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,115
<i>Quit staring.</i>

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,559
<i>I'm sort of between homes
right now.</i>

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,392
<i>I lost my old place...</i>

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,264
<i>thanks to the meanest bunch of
cattle rustlers in the west...</i>

35
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:45,067
<i>Alameda Slim
and the Willie Brothers gang.</i>

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,767
<i>Ooh-ee</i>

37
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,771
<i>Somehow,
they stole the whole herd...</i>

38
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,371
<i>right out
from under our noses...</i>

39
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,181
<i>and then they disappeared
without a trace.</i>

40
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,124
<i>After that...</i>

41
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,855
<i>poor old Abner couldn't
afford to keep the place...</i>

42
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,489
<i>or me, either, for that matter.</i>

43
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,264
<i>Well, no matter how bad
things get...</i>

44
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,068
<i>there's probably somebody
worse off.</i>

45
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,209
<i>That guy, for instance.</i>

46
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,770
<i>Hey, Maggie.</i>

47
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,782
Take a look at your new home.

48
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,081
<i>Hey! A dairy farm?</i>

49
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,451
<i>Now we're talkin'!</i>

50
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,321
<i>Hope it's not one of them
fat-free places.</i>

51
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,953
<i>I know a place</i>

52
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,556
<i>Pretty as pie</i>

53
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,259
<i>Out where the river bend</i>

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,064
<i>Hits up
with the end of the sky</i>

55
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,537
<i>It's left of Nebraska</i>

56
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,040
<i>And over a crest</i>

57
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,204
<i>On a little Patch of Heaven
way out west</i>

58
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,440
<i>Everything's green</i>

59
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,779
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

60
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,681
<i>Darlin', it's quite
the sweetest sight</i>

61
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,482
<i>That you ever done seen</i>

62
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,989
<i>Ain't nothin' much
out there</i>

63
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,049
<i>Just life at its best</i>

64
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:18,325
<i>On a little Patch of Heaven
way out west</i>

65
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,525
<i>Bees by the dozen</i>

66
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,263
<i>Are buzzin' real peaceful</i>

67
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,295
<i>Every bluebonnet,
doggone it, smells nice</i>

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,070
<i>Even
the tumblin' tumbleweed</i>

69
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,043
<i>Slows down
to match your speed</i>

70
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,570
<i>On my tiny half an acre
of paradise</i>

71
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,106
<i>Darlin', I swear</i>

72
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,551
<i>Once you been there</i>

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,885
<i>There ain't a view
beneath the blue</i>

74
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,254
<i>That could ever compare</i>

75
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,953
<i>The only thing missing</i>

76
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,292
<i>Is you as my guest</i>

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,699
<i>On a little Patch of Heaven
way out west</i>

78
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,464
<i>Why don't you come visit?</i>

79
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,803
<i>There's room in the nest</i>

80
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,968
<i>On that little
Patch of Heaven</i>

81
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,970
<i>Way out we-e-e-e...</i>

82
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,382
<i>...e-e-e-est</i>

83
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,590
Wah! Aaah! Ooh! Uhh!

84
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,057
Oh! Uhh!

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,659
Hey, that's my boy.

86
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,252
<i>Can hog! Can hog!</i>

87
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,923
Don't yell at me.

88
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,795
Oh. The call of duty.

89
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,892
Why don't you handle this one,
Grace?

90
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,302
It's time I gave you
more responsibility on the farm.

91
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,499
Really?

92
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,338
Thanks, Mrs. C.
I'll make you proud.

93
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,503
Can hog! Can hog!

94
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,102
Get off my case,
little cocktail wieners!

95
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,306
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

96
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,111
I'm sensing a lot
of negative energy here.

97
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,448
That's our can, and Jeb took it.

98
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,784
And now he says it's his can.

99
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,483
Now, let's not play
the shame and blame game.

100
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:56,188
This is an organic problem,
and there's a holistic solution.

101
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,257
You don't get this whole
farm concept, do you, sister?

102
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,529
Kill the goat!

103
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,002
- Give it!
- Get the can!

104
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,671
- Ahem.
- We're sorry, Mrs. Caloway.

105
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,738
Piggies,
why can't you leave Jeb alone?

106
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,010
Yeah! Why can't you?

107
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,848
The poor old goat
needs peace and quiet.

108
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,285
That's right! I need it!

109
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,051
So, run along,
and take your can with you.

110
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,614
Yeah, you take that can and...

111
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,319
Hey! Whoa! Come back here,
you little bacon bits!

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,126
Jeb, don't you have
enough cans of your own?

113
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,792
Uh, no, not really.

114
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,666
I'd be happy to take her in,
Abner.

115
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,536
There's always room
for one more.

116
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,039
Well, thanks, Pearl.

117
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,735
I gotta warn you, though.

118
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,403
She's... heh heh...
she's a bit headstrong.

119
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,504
Oh, now, don't you worry, Abner.

120
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,811
I'm sure she'll fit right in.

121
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,477
So long, Pearl.
You take care, now.

122
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,147
Mrs. Caloway! Oh! Mrs. Caloway!
Mrs. Calo...

123
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,058
Mrs. Caloway,
there's a newcomer at the gate.

124
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,221
- Not now, Audrey.
- But it's a great big...

125
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,060
Everybody? This here is Maggie.

126
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,396
<i>Three-time winner
of the Golden Udder Award...</i>

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,932
<i>and the original
Miss Happy Heifer.</i>

128
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,070
A show cow?

129
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,774
On Patch of Heaven?

130
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,097
<i>Now, I want y'all
to make her feel right at home.</i>

131
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,928
You hear me?

132
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,093
Hey, thanks, everybody.

133
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,263
It's great to be here
in Patch of Heaven.

134
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,431
Now, don't everybody speak
at one time.

135
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,634
<i>What is this,
the frozen food section?</i>

136
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,775
Is this thing on?

137
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,915
Ahem.
Good morning, uh, Margaret.

138
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,416
What a wonderful surprise...

139
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,942
to find a fellow bovine
joining the ranks.

140
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,215
Phony.

141
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,381
Ooh!

142
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,220
- I'm Mrs. Caloway.
- Hi.

143
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,988
- And this is Grace.
- Hi.

144
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,996
No applause and trophies here,
I'm afraid.

145
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,658
Just the fruits
of our good, honest labor.

146
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,825
Hi.

147
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,165
Workin' stiffs, huh?

148
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,330
Boy, I remember those days.

149
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,570
Wow! You're the biggest cow
I have ever saw.

150
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,339
Well, if you're in charge,
I'll take that as a compliment.

151
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,505
- Uh...
- And if you're not...

152
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,071
I guess
I'll just have to sit on you.

153
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,912
Mom!

154
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,713
Hey, I'm only kidding!

155
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,654
Say, what is this you've got
jammed up in your ear?

156
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,088
Whoa!

157
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,684
Here, have an apple, kid.

158
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,660
Don't go near any luaus, though.

159
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,526
Wait a minute.

160
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,794
I got somethin' stuck in my ear.

161
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,302
This one's for me.

162
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,537
Ahh! That was good.

163
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,006
Awesome!

164
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,009
Do it again! Do it again!

165
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,274
Come on, come on!
Do it again! Do it again!

166
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,679
<i>Oh! That's so cool!</i>

167
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,876
Maggie's some fun, isn't she?

168
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,351
Ohh.
Teaching pigs to throw food.

169
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,377
<i>As if they weren't
sloppy enough.</i>

170
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,118
I'm goin' long!

171
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,254
Heh heh heh.

172
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,523
Ohh!

173
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,074
Whoa! Whoa!

174
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,838
Dagnabit, Buck, slow down!

175
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,678
OK, who's up for a game
of tin-can tag?

176
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,307
Hey!
That can is a family heirloom.

177
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,184
Whoever wins is gettin'
a free tetanus shot! OK?

178
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,380
Superstar comin' through!

179
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,183
Awesome!

180
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,092
- No autographs, please.
- I got your autograph, pal! Ow!

181
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,527
Who's the hotshot?

182
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,555
- Oh, it's Buck.
- Puh! City slicker.

183
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,864
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!
Dagnabit, Buck!

184
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,770
Take it easy.
This ain't no rodeo.

185
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,399
Why, good morning, Sam.
Heh heh.

186
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,001
Is that ornery horse
gettin' away from you again?

187
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,944
Oh, uh, howdy, Pearl.

188
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,005
I came out to bring you
another bank notice.

189
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,448
This one'll be the last.

190
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,543
You know, every time
I get a weak harvest...

191
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,451
they send me
one of these here notices.

192
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,115
They'll get their money
soon enough.

193
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,523
<i>It's a whole new
shootin' match now, Pearl.</i>

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,585
<i>The bank's callin' in
everybody's debt.</i>

195
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,789
They're losin' money
somethin' fierce...

196
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,627
<i>with all the cattlemen
goin' under.</i>

197
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,725
I'm tellin' you, if they don't
get their money in three days...

198
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,895
they're gonna auction off
Patch of Heaven.

199
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,802
What?

200
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,396
No.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,000
But... they can't take my place.

202
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,240
Why, I've been here
through twisters, blizzards.

203
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,042
Sam, uh...

204
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,209
Sam, this is my home.

205
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,552
I'm sorry, Pearl.
I'm truly sorry.

206
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,957
Yeah, well...

207
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,588
"sorry"
just ain't gonna save my farm.

208
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Well, Buck,
I hope you're proud of yourself.

209
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,266
As a matter of fact, I am.
Thank you for checking.

210
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,470
You know, Pearl,
it don't have to be this way.

211
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,277
<i>You've got the best livestock
in the county.</i>

212
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,681
All you gotta do...

213
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,948
is just sell off
a few of these critters...

214
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,454
Stop right there, Sam.

215
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,457
They're family.
You don't sell family.

216
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,788
Ho-ho-hold your horses, Pearl.

217
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,953
Now you get,
before I start using words...

218
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,327
no good woman should ever use.

219
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,026
- Don't bust your gusset, woman!
- Go on, Sam!

220
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,194
It is still my property!
Now get!

221
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,931
I said, get!

222
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,496
I was just tryin' to help!

223
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,307
Oh. Oh.

224
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,115
That sure took the starch
right out of me.

225
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,490
<i>I am sorry, girls.</i>

226
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,763
I'm just plum out of ideas.

227
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,675
Well, I think we all know
what happens now.

228
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,310
- Uh, Jeb, don't start.
- Now we all get eaten.

229
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,819
- Jeb?
- What? What?

230
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,048
You don't think people in town
eat animals?

231
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,717
But who would eat a chicken?
Heh heh.

232
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,522
Come on, guys. There must be
something we can do.

233
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,552
What? What could we do?

234
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,427
Ohh...

235
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,662
- This just isn't fair.
- Fair!

236
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,670
Good call, Curly!

237
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,069
- Ollie.
- Ollie.

238
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,039
Uh, what is?

239
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,565
Listen. What would you say
if I told you...

240
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,373
that you could win big money...

241
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,176
and see
beautiful downtown Chugwater...

242
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,445
if you went to the County Fair?

243
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,951
Ohh.

244
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,748
Thank you for your input, but...

245
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,017
Come on! Let the new cow talk!

246
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,752
New cow! New cow! New cow!

247
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:11,092
Come on, Mrs. C. You've got
a real good-lookin' bunch here.

248
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,859
<i>I see some real potential.</i>

249
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,388
Aw, shucks.

250
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,401
Now, the fair is two weeks away.

251
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,268
I say we go to town, butter up
that sheriff's horse...

252
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,432
and get him
to give us more time.

253
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,704
What are we waitin' for, Maggie?
Let's go.

254
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,211
That's right.
What do you say, Caloway?

255
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,237
Bah! Absolutely not.

256
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,613
I will not abandon Pearl
in her hour of need...

257
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,981
<i>for such a ridiculous plan.</i>

258
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,146
She would be devastated
if she found us missing.

259
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,452
As far as I'm concerned,
that's not an option.

260
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,460
All right. Suit yourself.

261
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,055
Come on, Grace.
We've got a farm to save.

262
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,931
Oh, you'll have to excuse her.
She's just a little tense.

263
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,667
Tense. What's her specialty,
sour cream?

264
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,533
Going to town.

265
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,068
Of all the ill-conceived i...

266
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,518
Now, don't look at me
so crossly.

267
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,986
I know what
you're going to say...

268
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,012
<i>that Maggie and Grace
will need someone...</i>

269
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,455
<i>with my eye for detail...</i>

270
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,450
<i>to keep them
on the straight and narrow.</i>

271
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,430
Say no more. I'll go.

272
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,332
Now, tut tut. No mushy
good-byes, my little ones.

273
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,031
You know how I get
about overly emotional displays.

274
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,868
<i>Ahem. Ladies?</i>

275
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,372
<i>Mrs. C.</i>

276
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,641
Well,
what made you change your mind?

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,444
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- It's a chick thing.

278
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,143
<i>Good luck, girls!</i>

279
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,156
- See ya!
- Bye!

280
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,921
- They're stew meat.
- Hurry back!

281
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,567
<i>She'll be
comin' 'round the mountain</i>

282
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,634
<i>She'll be comin'
'round the mountain</i>

283
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,543
<i>She'll be comin' 'round...</i>

284
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,343
She better hurry up
around that mountain...

285
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,144
'cause I cannot take this
much longer.

286
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,549
Maggie, may I be frank?

287
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,487
Only if you let me wear the hat.

288
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,515
Ahem. Lowbrow remarks
may work for you...

289
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,722
but we prefer
the gentle approach.

290
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,230
Well, she better
stick a sock in it soon.

291
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,166
The vultures
are starting to circle.

292
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,697
Hey, she's not dying!

293
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,935
You sure? We could wait around!

294
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,773
<i>...no, nothing,
when she sees Grandma</i>

295
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,711
<i>No more food for her</i>

296
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,543
We'll keep you posted!

297
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,809
False alarm, Clem!

298
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,680
Roger dodger, out like the wind!

299
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,551
Hey, Maggie, Mrs. C?
How do we find...

300
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,521
the sheriff's office
when we get into town?

301
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,183
Elementary, my dear Grace.

302
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,351
If we find Buck,
we find the sheriff.

303
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,487
That horse is a legend
in his own mind.

304
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,100
<i>Ah ha ha ha ha!</i>

305
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
So, you think
you got the drop on me?

306
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,213
Well, think again.

307
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,547
Wahoo!

308
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,280
<i>Wah! Wah!</i>

309
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,981
<i>Wah!</i>

310
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,785
Yah-hoo! Hyah!

311
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,487
Hmm.

312
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,790
Wooh!

313
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,725
Aah!

314
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,501
Haaay! Jump back! Kiss myself!

315
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,270
<i>Buck. Earth to Buck? Buck!</i>

316
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,710
It's your move.

317
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,183
Ohh... great.

318
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,689
You were sleep-fighting again.
Almost threw a shoe.

319
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,249
Ohh. Sorry. Heh.

320
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,353
It just... it seems like
all the other horses...

321
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,956
are out there fighting bad guys
and takin' names!

322
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,465
Uhh! Who put this here?

323
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,733
Oh, Buck,
this ain't no Dodge City...

324
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,967
but we get our share
of excitement.

325
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,532
<i>Hey, sheriff!</i>

326
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,841
<i>Been waitin' a long time
to give you this!</i>

327
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,039
Telegram!

328
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,141
Oh, howdy, Morse.
What you got there?

329
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,516
<i>Hmm. "Got Evil Eye Joe. Stop.</i>

330
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,783
"Bringing him today. Stop.

331
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,586
Have money ready. Signed, Rico. "

332
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,859
Ha! Oh, yeah!
Rico caught another one already.

333
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,194
Might as well give him
the key to my safe.

334
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,359
You hear that, Rusty?
Rico's comin'.

335
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,131
Yeah, Rico.
I'm old. I ain't deaf.

336
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,694
Boy, wouldn't that be the life?

337
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,105
Ridin' with Rico,
cleanin' up the west.

338
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,008
Kickin' bad-guy behind!
Whoo! Wah-yah!

339
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,275
Watch out, sucker!

340
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,814
All right, girls.
We're goin' in.

341
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,122
Look! There's no fences.

342
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,151
What keeps the people
from roaming?

343
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,026
<i>They appear to be domesticated.</i>

344
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,191
It doesn't feel dangerous
at all.

345
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,862
It's perfectly safe.
Quiet as a farm at milkin' time.

346
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,427
What was that?

347
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,904
It's a gunfight!

348
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,546
- Aah! Hit the dirt!
- Who lives like this?

349
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,242
What do we do? What do we do?

350
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,841
Look,
there's a star on that door!

351
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,716
That must be
the sheriff's office.

352
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,880
<i>Move, ladies! Move!</i>

353
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,823
<i>Swivel your hips, ooh!
Give 'em a grind</i>

354
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,725
<i>Shimmy and shake
and leave your troubles be...</i>

355
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,496
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

356
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,900
- Whoa!
- Get those cows off the stage!

357
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,932
Maybe we came at a bad time.

358
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,133
Charge!

359
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,735
Uhh!

360
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,746
Oh! Oh!

361
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,872
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

362
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,215
- How dare you?
- Oh!

363
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,277
Whoa-oh-oh!

364
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,983
- Aaaah... uhh!
- Uhh!

365
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,651
- Daddy?
- Son!

366
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,690
I say! Aah!

367
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,134
Aah! Oh! Ow! What did I do?

368
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,302
<i>That does it!</i>

369
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,311
<i>Hoof it on out of here, ladies!</i>

370
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,813
- Go on!
- Oh, come back!

371
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,180
That was the best dang show
we ever had!

372
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,947
Aw, you've been on the trail
too long, you old coot.

373
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,978
Ohh. What kind of
sheriff's office is that?

374
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,922
Dancing girls, gambling...

375
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,949
Ha! How does he ever
get any work done?

376
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:52,453
If that's the sheriff's office,
this town rocks.

377
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,896
Well, if it isn't
three maids a-milkin'.

378
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,701
You girls a little far
from home, aren't ya?

379
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,037
Well, if it isn't
the phony express.

380
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,942
We want a word with you
about this.

381
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,376
- What's that?
- What is that?

382
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,440
I believe you left this
on our farm.

383
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,009
Wai... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

384
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,183
The place went bankrupt.
Your farm is history.

385
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,124
Don't you heifers get it?

386
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,855
Hold on, you two!

387
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,055
Give us two more weeks...

388
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,496
and we'll have at least
sixty bucks in prize money to...

389
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,194
Ah-ah-ah. You got three days
to pay or get on your way.

390
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,361
And sixty bucks don't cut it.

391
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,667
Looks like you need about...

392
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,071
Hmm, I'd say...

393
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,702
seven hundred and fifty of 'em.

394
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,178
But, Maggie, where are we
gonna get all that money?

395
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,115
Well, maybe Maggie
can just pull it out of her ear.

396
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,708
Hey, watch it, Caloway.

397
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,093
- Rico.
- Rico.

398
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,688
- Rico.
- Rico.

399
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,348
Who is that?

400
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,185
- Shh.
- Sorry.

401
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,855
Don't you know a hero
when you see one, huh?

402
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,190
That's Rico...

403
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,288
the best dang bounty hunter
this side of the Pecos.

404
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,731
I could guess
from here to tomorrow...

405
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,791
but I don't know
how you do it, Rico.

406
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,303
- Mmf!
- Where's my money?

407
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,774
Well, all right,
I got it right here for you.

408
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,174
Hey, they're giving away
free money!

409
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,438
Oh! Maggie!

410
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,537
So, who else is out there?

411
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,706
The only varmint left...

412
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,047
is that low-down,
good-for-nothin' Alameda Slim.

413
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,780
Cattle rustler.

414
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,278
- What's the bounty?
- $750.

415
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,951
I got it!

416
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,553
Why don't we go nab
that Alameda Slim...

417
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,120
and use the reward money
to save the farm?

418
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,894
Oh, that is a sensible idea.

419
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,902
I knew you'd love it!

420
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,599
Tch. Don't they have sarcasm
where you come from?

421
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,076
Oh, wake up and smell
the alfalfa! It's perfect!

422
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,668
I'm gonna need a fresh horse.

423
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,815
Hmm, a horse. A horse.

424
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,078
Let me think.

425
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,576
I reckon you'd want
a fast horse, huh? Real fast?

426
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,885
Course, he'd also have
to be able to go...

427
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:35,415
<i>for days
without food or drink...</i>

428
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,396
<i>stealthy,
sure-footed in any terrain...</i>

429
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,989
<i>Well, huh...</i>

430
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,593
- Look at me!
- What about that horse?

431
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,297
What, you mean Buck here?

432
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,999
- Eee!
- Boy, I don't know.

433
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,635
Buck's fast, all right,
but he's kind of a handful.

434
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,443
- He'll do.
- Well, suit yourself.

435
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,675
Hey, Rusty!

436
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,378
Rico's saddle!
I'm wearing Rico's saddle!

437
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,046
I'm wearing Rico's saddle!

438
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,453
Great. I'll leave you two alone.

439
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,354
Ohh, oh, no. No, no, no.

440
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,382
There is no way
in heaven or earth...

441
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,156
that cows can catch an outlaw.

442
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,958
Look, all we've got to do...

443
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,455
is follow this chuck wagon
to a cattle drive.

444
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,025
Ahh. And then, you see...

445
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,970
we let the bad guys come to us.

446
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,565
Oh! We've
no reason to believe...

447
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,474
this chuck wagon is heading off
to a cattle drive.

448
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,479
Hey, Tommy!
Have fun on that cattle drive!

449
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,538
All right, then. Mm-hmm.

450
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,608
I think it is
headed toward a cattle drive.

451
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,679
Shh. We are not following
this wagon, and that is final.

452
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,090
Come on, Caloway. It'll be fun!

453
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,890
- Did you just hit me?
- Kinda.

454
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,227
- Well, stop it.
- Why?

455
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,526
Because I don't like it.

456
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,428
Ooh!

457
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,602
Oh, no. Not the hat.

458
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:01,942
What? What about the...

459
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,072
Unh!

460
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,946
Hmph.

461
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,980
All right, all right...

462
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,717
violence is not going
to solve anything.

463
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,955
Why don't we all take
a deep cleansing breath...

464
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,325
- Yaah!
- Yaah!

465
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,594
Hey, now! Mud wrestling!

466
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,932
Ha ha! Hey, hey!
Watch the saddle!

467
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,876
What in tarnation?

468
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,377
Maggie, for the last time...

469
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,313
I will not be roped
into this scheme.

470
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,784
Come on, you crazy heifers!

471
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,752
Come on! Dagnabit!

472
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,950
Hey, partner,
curb your livestock.

473
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,514
<i>This town is clean!</i>

474
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,918
Giddy-up!

475
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,087
Ack!

476
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,292
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but this'll work.

477
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,800
Well, it doesn't work for me!

478
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,998
Adios, Buck.
Take care of Rico now.

479
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,170
Hasta la vista, heifers!
Hoo hoo!

480
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,310
<i>Oh, give me a home</i>

481
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,376
<i>Where the buffalo roam</i>

482
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,757
<i>And the deer... ahem...
and the antelope pla-a-ay</i>

483
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,557
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>

484
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,123
<i>A discouraging word</i>

485
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,658
<i>And the skies
are not cloudy all day</i>

486
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,302
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

487
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,436
- Sold!
- What was that?

488
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,107
It's a farm auction, ladies.

489
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,843
<i>And that's the last
of the furniture.</i>

490
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,214
<i>The final item
to be auctioned...</i>

491
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,878
<i>is this piece
of real property...</i>

492
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,218
<i>known heretofore
as the Dixon farm.</i>

493
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,783
<i>Do I hear 425? 425!
Do I hear 450? 450?</i>

494
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,818
What's going to happen
to the cow who lived there?

495
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,989
She'll be OK.

496
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,726
- How do you know?
- You're lookin' at her.

497
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,167
- This was your farm?
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:09,003
We had, like, a family, too,
you know.

499
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,476
- What happened?
- Alameda Slim happened.

500
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,606
Aah!

501
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,678
Sold to Mr. Yancy O'Del!

502
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,746
Pleasure
doing business with you.

503
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,969
<i>Cattle drive. Told ya.</i>

504
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,406
<i>You both owe me a dollar.</i>

505
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,703
Step lightly, girls.

506
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,837
The male of the species
can be extremely hostile.

507
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,540
Oh, come on, Caloway.

508
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,947
It's not like they haven't
seen a cow before.

509
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,315
Mmm? Ohh...

510
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,547
Hey, Barry.

511
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,318
- What? Huh?
- Check it out.

512
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,121
Ooh, dairy cows!

513
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,684
Oooh!

514
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,457
Oh, hey, how's it going?

515
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,456
<i>Oh, hello. Let me guess.
You're a Taurus.</i>

516
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,902
Look, just keep moving
and avoid eye contact.

517
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,769
- Ahem.
- Oh!

518
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,139
Pardon me, but what are
three lovely ladies like you...

519
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,576
doing on a drive like this?

520
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,206
Just ignore them,
and perhaps they'll go away.

521
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,479
Oh, they seem like nice guys.
Maybe they can help us.

522
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,452
Why, sure we can help you.

523
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,818
Maybe we can help each other.

524
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,914
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

525
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,792
Look, lover-bull,
we're here strictly on business.

526
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,389
Ooh, sounds pretty exciting.
What kind of business?

527
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,959
We're looking for a cattle
rustler named Alameda Slim.

528
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,128
- Grace! Shh!
- Grace! Shh!

529
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,797
Hey, it doesn't hurt to ask.

530
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,567
Slim? Oh ho ho ho!

531
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,508
Why, Slim's just
a scary bedtime story...

532
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,306
<i>to get little calves to behave.</i>

533
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,512
- Uhh!
- Ooh!

534
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,642
What was that?

535
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,311
It must be Slim and the Willies.

536
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,843
Slim and the Willies?

537
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,651
Don't worry, darlin'.
I'll protect you.

538
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,682
You have exactly two seconds
to remove your hoof...

539
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,524
before I snap it off
at the knee.

540
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,463
Oh, uh, sorry, ma'am.
I thought you were the blonde.

541
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,193
Ooh!

542
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,600
Come on, girls.
It's time to lose these ropes.

543
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,540
Where you going? Ho-yah! Hyah!

544
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,305
- Maggie, I'm stuck.
- Look out!

545
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,538
Hahh!

546
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,485
It's payback time.

547
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,512
- Cover me!
- With what?

548
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,716
- Howdy, Slim.
- Howdy, Slim.

549
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,454
Quiet, you fools.
We've got work to do.

550
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,394
<i>Now listen up.</i>

551
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,454
<i>There are crooks
in this here west</i>

552
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,966
<i>Who have claimed
to be the best</i>

553
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,628
<i>And they think they wrote
the book on how to rustle</i>

554
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,830
- Aah!
- Aah!

555
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,600
<i>Well,
as good as they may be</i>

556
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,470
<i>Not a one's as good as me</i>

557
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,966
<i>And I barely have to move
a single muscle</i>

558
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,605
<i>They call me mean, boys</i>

559
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,274
<i>Depraved and nasty, too</i>

560
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,806
<i>And they ain't seen, boys</i>

561
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,478
<i>The cruelest thing I do</i>

562
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,655
<i>You see I
yodel-adle-eedle-idle-odle</i>

563
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,151
<i>The sweetest way of rustlin'
yet devised</i>

564
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,530
<i>'Cause when I
yodel-adle-eedle-idle-odle</i>

565
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,594
<i>Why, looky,
how them cows get hypnotized</i>

566
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,538
<i>He don't prod,
he don't yell</i>

567
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,165
<i>Still he drives
them dogies well</i>

568
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,972
<i>Which ain't easy
when your chaps are labeled</i>

569
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,672
<i>X- X-X-X-L</i>

570
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,876
<i>Yes, if yer lookin'
from a bovine point of view</i>

571
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,680
<i>I sure can
yodel-adle-eedle-idle</i>

572
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,778
<i>Yodel-adle-eedle-idle</i>

573
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,383
<i>Yodel-adle-eedle-idle-oo</i>

574
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:52,863
Here we go, boys!
5,000 cattle in the side pocket!

575
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>Ooh</i>

576
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,985
Maggie! Mrs. Caloway!
Snap out of it!

577
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:27,623
<i>A sound that cattle
truly take to heart</i>

578
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,257
<i>Yeah, I can
yodel-adle-eedle-idle</i>

579
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,825
<i>Yodel-adle-eedle-idel-odle</i>

580
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,431
<i>And smack my big old rump
if that ain't art</i>

581
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,998
<i>He don't rope,
not a chance</i>

582
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,942
<i>He just puts 'em
in a trance</i>

583
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,470
<i>He's a pioneer pied piper
in ten-gallon underpants</i>

584
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,483
<i>Yep, I'm the real
rip-roarin' deal</i>

585
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,178
<i>To those who moo</i>

586
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,016
<i>Thanks
to my yodel-adle-eedle-idle</i>

587
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,318
<i>Yodel-adle-eedle-idle</i>

588
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,190
<i>I got cattle
out the old wazoo, heh heh!</i>

589
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,595
<i>'Cause I can
yodel-adle-eedle-idle-oo</i>

590
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,532
<i>Yodel-adle-eedle-idle-oo</i>

591
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,504
Whoa. Ho, boy.

592
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,273
Unh!

593
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,613
Hmm...

594
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,086
Rico, if you'd just been
a second earlier...

595
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,055
you'd have had that rustler
dead to rights.

596
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,024
You boys see anything
before I got here?

597
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,549
Yeah, we sure did there, Rico.

598
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,221
We were just
settin' down to supper...

599
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:35,028
when all of a sudden
the lights went out.

600
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:39,127
All right, what part of
"cover me" didn't we understand?

601
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,161
- You guys OK?
- I don't know.

602
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,901
I feel like I was dreaming.

603
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,239
Yeah. Slim started singing...

604
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,870
and all of a sudden
I lost track of everything.

605
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,608
Singing? That didn't sound
like singing to me.

606
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,673
And, you know,
I have perfect pitch.

607
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,880
Uh, yes. Grace,
about your perfect pitch...

608
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,582
- Not now, Maggie.
- All right, show's over!

609
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,250
Oh, no.

610
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,021
You're interfering
with official police bidness!

611
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,552
Ha. Be right with you, big guy.

612
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,862
Buck is on the case.
You know. Whoo!

613
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,529
Don't embarrass me
in front of my partner. Please!

614
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,004
You and he are partners?

615
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,304
So, how does that work exactly?

616
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,278
I mean, do you get to ride him
on odd days or even?

617
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,507
Hey! He chose me specifically...

618
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,709
because I have skills
that are essential...

619
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,684
to capturing our quarry.

620
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,785
Huh?

621
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,519
Ha ha ha!

622
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,891
Whoo! Smush! Oof!

623
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,922
You boys headed back to town?

624
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,833
Yes, sir. We got to go file
a report with the sheriff.

625
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,268
Give him back his horse.

626
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,137
This one's too skittish
around cows.

627
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,870
And that, girls,
is what makes me and Rico...

628
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,211
<i>equal parts of
one lean mean crime-fighting...</i>

629
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,985
machine?

630
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,681
Well, there it is, then.

631
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,718
Well, well, well, stud.

632
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,957
Now, I'm no professional...

633
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:16,956
but I'd say the only
mano a mano you'll be doing...

634
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,559
is in your dreams.

635
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,195
Oh, look out, Buck.

636
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,139
He's making a move
on your left flank. Kaboosh!

637
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,938
Maggie! Grace!
Leave that poor animal alone.

638
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,273
Buck,
I realize you're very upset...

639
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,181
<i>but if you'd like
to join our group...</i>

640
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,744
<i>and help us bring in Slim,
we'd be happy to have you.</i>

641
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,279
However, there are a few...

642
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,657
anger-management issues
we need to discuss.

643
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,060
I wouldn't help
you bossy bovines...

644
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,030
if my life depended on it!

645
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,124
You see, that's just
what I'm talking about.

646
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,795
- Grace!
- Bye.

647
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,894
- Come on, girls.
- Hmm.

648
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,370
<i>Let's go get Slim.</i>

649
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,965
"Come on, girls,
let's go get Slim. "

650
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,999
Cud-chewing heifers.

651
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,535
Huh. I can catch that Slim with
one hoof tied behind my back.

652
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,845
Wait a minute. Why don't I?

653
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,785
Yes! Partner or no partner,
that's what I'm-a do. Hey!

654
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,618
<i>Ba ba ba ba ba</i>

655
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,715
<i>Hold the horse now.</i>

656
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,823
<i>Aw, forget it.</i>

657
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,693
Definitely bipolar.

658
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,063
Move it, sister!
Hero passing on the left!

659
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,069
- Hey, watch it.
- Where are you going, hotfoot?

660
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,297
I'm gonna go nab that rustler...

661
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,805
and show Rico
I got what it takes...

662
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,367
so say good-bye to your farm,
girls, because Slim is mine.

663
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,968
It's hero time!

664
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,173
Watch out now! Hey! Get back!

665
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,148
Jump back! Kiss myself! Whoo!

666
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,308
<i>Da da yoo</i>

667
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,818
Oh, this is
a fine kettle of fish.

668
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,912
How can we compete with that?

669
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,547
Look at the bright side, Mrs. C.

670
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,582
Don't forget about
our secret weapon.

671
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,059
Secret weapon?

672
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,688
Who better to catch
a cattle thief than a cow?

673
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,427
Yeah, even you can't argue
with that kind of logic.

674
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,162
OK, maybe you can.

675
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,328
You know, Grace...

676
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,396
Maggie does so love
your singing.

677
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,566
How about a song?

678
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,235
I'm gonna get you for this.

679
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,344
Ha ha! 5,000 Texas longhorns.

680
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,047
Not bad for one night's work.

681
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,113
<i>Pick a color.</i>

682
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,217
<i>I said,
not bad for one night's work.</i>

683
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,285
- What?
- Thank you.

684
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,229
And judging by the ear mark...

685
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,361
I'd say these are the last
of Big Mike Donald's herd.

686
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,427
Big Mike Donald had a farm?

687
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,961
- E-I-E-I...
- E-I-E-I...

688
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,940
- Ohh...
- Ohh...

689
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:40,603
That's right. He had a farm.
Heh heh heh.

690
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,374
Now that all his cash cows
have disappeared...

691
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,506
<i>that poor sap's
gonna be flat broke.</i>

692
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,313
<i>Perfect time for a certain
upstanding land owner...</i>

693
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,683
to step in
and take all the land.

694
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,278
Aah! Who are you?

695
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,586
What did you do
with Uncle Slim?

696
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,593
Put up your dukes,
Mr. Fancy Britches.

697
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,889
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah!

698
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,760
It's me. Hello?

699
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,697
This here
is the disguise I use...

700
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,495
to sneak into
all them auctions...

701
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,970
and buy all the land,
you brainless monotone monkeys.

702
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,997
Shoot, you got to be the richest
land baron in the west.

703
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,136
Yes, but the part
that really warms my heart...

704
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,738
is watching those homesteaders
suffer.

705
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,612
Back in the day, I worked...

706
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,449
the highfalutinest ranches
you ever seen...

707
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,822
but those stuck-up ranch bosses
couldn't appreciate my talents.

708
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,123
Maybe they just didn't like
your singing.

709
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,153
My singing?

710
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:38,024
Songbirds sing.

711
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,196
<i>Saloon gals sing.</i>

712
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,174
Little bitty snot-nosed
children sing.

713
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,267
I yodel!

714
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,540
And yodeling is an art!

715
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,639
Well, maybe they just
didn't like your yodeling.

716
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,052
He didn't mean it, Uncle Slim.

717
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,612
<i>Everybody likes yodeling.</i>

718
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,487
Hmm?

719
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:06,259
Why, it's one of the funniest,
cornball, goofy, silly sounds...

720
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,696
in the whole west.

721
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,132
Yaah! Aah! Yaah!

722
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,270
- Uh, Gil?
- Uh-huh?

723
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,367
Am I correct in assuming
that each and every time...

724
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,277
we brought a herd back
to this secret lair...

725
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,771
you've managed to sit
in the exact same spot...

726
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,718
blocking that choice
piece of property from my view?!

727
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,554
This is my comfy place.

728
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,560
What? Aah!

729
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,653
<i>It's called
Patch of Heaven, Uncle Slim.</i>

730
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,324
Goes on auction
Thursday morning.

731
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,265
Perfect. Pencil it in.

732
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,464
Thursday morning... right after
we sell off this herd.

733
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,166
But it's just
a little old dirt farm.

734
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,606
Ah, what's the difference?

735
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:57,410
When you're talking revenge,
every last acre counts.

736
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,692
I don't get it.

737
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,859
Weren't the cows
supposed to come back?

738
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,631
Daddy, what's going to happen
if they don't come back?

739
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,230
Oh, but they are coming back.

740
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,367
Hogwash! We all know
they're never coming back.

741
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,933
What? Ooh! Ooh!

742
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,914
You don't know that, Jeb.

743
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,916
Everybody knows that bovines...

744
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,613
are the most intelligent,
crafty animals in the west.

745
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,281
Yeah. He's right, you know.

746
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,018
It doesn't take a cow
to figure out...

747
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,889
they saw
the writing on the wall...

748
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,986
and flown the coop
while the getting was good.

749
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,087
What?

750
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,156
Oh, no!
They tricked us and deserted us!

751
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,827
No, no. Aud-Audrey.

752
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,730
Excuse me. Excuse me.

753
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,003
Excuse me!

754
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:04,877
Oh, uh, let's not forget
who we're talkin' 'bout.

755
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,941
Audrey, remember when
Grace helped you figure out...

756
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,351
<i>why you crossed the road?</i>

757
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,983
And, Jeb, Miss Caloway
knew just what to do...

758
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,152
when your head got stuck
in that spittoon.

759
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,319
Get off my case!

760
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,353
And Maggie
was gonna make us all winners.

761
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,196
I truly believe
there ain't nothin'...

762
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,634
those three cows can't do.

763
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,170
Aw...

764
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:38,113
Well, whatever they're gonna do,
they better do it soon.

765
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,347
I'm so very sorry, Pearl.

766
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,844
It's a real shame. It is.

767
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,321
Ollie,
I don't know what's worse...

768
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,198
losing my farm
to the highest bidder...

769
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:02,763
or knowing that... that my girls
are lost and alone out there.

770
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,145
- Yee-haw!
- Come on, girls.

771
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,546
Either
I'm getting good at this...

772
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,072
or his scent
is getting stronger.

773
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,711
Go get him, Maggie.
Look out, Slim!

774
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,154
- No. It can't be.
- We're on your trail!

775
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,953
Hmm.

776
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,762
Hoo hoo!

777
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,678
<i>Oops.</i>

778
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,942
<i>This has Buck
written all over it.</i>

779
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,814
We're not gonna let
this dumb old trick stop us.

780
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,719
Sooner or later, all these paths
will hook up, and then...

781
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,716
<i>Oh, no, the tracks!</i>

782
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,454
Hurry up, girls.
Don't lose that trail.

783
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,520
What trail?
I can't see anything.

784
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,963
Look out!

785
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,565
Oh! Flash flood!

786
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,630
Get to high ground!

787
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,368
- Oh.
- Maggie!

788
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,416
Oh!

789
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,338
Maggie!

790
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,923
No! Come on, girls,
we can't give up!

791
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,456
Maggie, that's enough.
The minute this lets up...

792
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,527
we're heading straight home
to Patch of Heaven.

793
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,472
But what about catching Slim
and collecting the reward?

794
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,872
We never had a prayer...

795
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,307
of catching Slim
in the first place.

796
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,970
<i>This whole ridiculous plan...</i>

797
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:25,175
is just so you can get revenge
on those cattle rustlers.

798
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,481
Hey!
For your information, duchess...

799
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,818
this whole ridiculous plan
is about us saving our farm.

800
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,324
Huh. Our farm might've had
a fighting chance...

801
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,620
until you came along.

802
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,354
What's that supposed to mean?

803
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,852
Strutting around with
your vulgar show-cow behavior.

804
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,092
Look, I was just having...

805
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,726
<i>Wasting our time
on your foolish plans.</i>

806
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,531
Through the years,
Patch of Heaven...

807
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,198
has survived every hardship
that nature can dish out...

808
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,366
but you, Maggie...

809
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:54,275
are the biggest catastrophe
to ever hit our farm.

810
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,370
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it...

811
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,711
maybe we should just go
our separate ways.

812
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,842
Now, that's the first
good idea you've ever had.

813
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,314
- Fine!
- Fine!

814
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,425
Yeah. Fine.

815
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,230
It's not like your farm...

816
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,238
was ever gonna feel like home
to me anyways.

817
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,882
<i>Rain is pourin' down</i>

818
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,018
<i>Like the heavens
are hurtin'</i>

819
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:49,090
<i>Seems like it's been dark
since the devil knows when</i>

820
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:54,400
<i>How do you go on
never knowing for certain</i>

821
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:59,535
<i>Will the sun
ever shine again?</i>

822
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,844
<i>Feels like it's been years
since it started to thunder</i>

823
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:10,377
<i>Clouds are campin' out
in the valley and glen</i>

824
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:16,451
<i>How do you go on when
you can't help but wonder</i>

825
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:21,260
<i>Will the sun
ever shine again?</i>

826
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:26,463
<i>What if the rain
keeps fallin'?</i>

827
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:31,907
<i>What if the sky
stays gray?</i>

828
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:38,177
<i>What if the winds
keep squallin'</i>

829
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:43,175
<i>And never go away?</i>

830
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,248
<i>Maybe soon the storm
will be tired of blowin'</i>

831
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,628
<i>Maybe soon
it all will be over, amen</i>

832
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:59,466
<i>How do you go on if
there's no way of knowin'?</i>

833
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,132
<i>Will the sun ever shine?</i>

834
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,640
<i>Wish I could say</i>

835
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,444
<i>Send me a sign</i>

836
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,277
<i>One little ray</i>

837
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,977
<i>Lord,
if you're listenin'</i>

838
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,682
<i>How long until then?</i>

839
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,851
<i>Will the sun ever shine</i>

840
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:30,629
<i>Again?</i>

841
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,517
Mmm...

842
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,497
Maggie. Maggie. Maggie.

843
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,524
- Wake up.
- Check, please!

844
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,706
It tasted a lot better
in my sleep.

845
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,875
Well, I suppose
you'll be off now.

846
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,715
- Mm-hmm.
- Where will you go?

847
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,313
Oh, probably check out
the Grand Canyon.

848
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,289
See Utah before I die.

849
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,519
Wait a minute. Where's Grace?

850
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,358
Hi, there.
Boy, am I glad you guys are up.

851
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,159
Hey, come look at this.

852
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,224
What on earth?
Where did all this come from?

853
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:41,465
Hey, it's green, it's leafy,
and it's free. Shut up and eat.

854
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,132
Good morning, ladies.

855
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,800
I see you're already
tucked into your appetizer.

856
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,106
Never knew a pretty lady
that didn't have an appetite.

857
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,135
Oh, now, see here, you ruffian...

858
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,579
He's not a ruffian,
Mrs. Caloway.

859
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:56,109
He's a genuine desert shaman...
our very own wise man.

860
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,644
Shaman, chef, chief cook,
and bottle washer.

861
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,556
I'm a jackrabbit of all trades
and at your service.

862
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,083
Folks around these parts
call me Lucky Jack.

863
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,688
Yep, they used to come
from miles around...

864
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,426
just to get one rub
of my lucky rabbit's foot.

865
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,434
Whoo! Dagnabit!

866
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,966
This happens all the time.
Now, where was I?

867
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,499
Ah. Voila.

868
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,569
<i>Now let me just
get this on the fire...</i>

869
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,911
and it'll be ready directly.

870
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,610
Mm-huh. Ow! Yow!

871
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,551
Look, we don't eat meat.

872
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,645
It's kind of like
a professional courtesy.

873
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,952
Perhaps we'll dine with you
some other time.

874
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,459
You see, Grace and I
are returning to our farm...

875
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,427
to say our last good-byes.

876
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,329
Yeah. We need closure.

877
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,492
Well, I can sympathize there,
sister, I truly can.

878
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,764
Until recently,
I, too, had a home.

879
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,498
Echo Mine it was called.

880
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:52,032
Us jackrabbits lived there
for generation after generation.

881
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,909
Till some land-grabbing bandit
moved in...

882
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:59,939
and flushed us out
like yesterday's oatmeal.

883
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:04,283
Ahem. Excuse us. My good fellow,
we must be on our way.

884
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,186
Wait! There he is!

885
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,290
Aah!

886
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,457
Slim! You mean
this no-good varmint...

887
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,332
is hiding out in Echo Mine
right now?

888
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,132
- Without a doubt.
- Maggie, what are you thinking?

889
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,937
Look, I got a score to settle
with that rhinestone fat boy...

890
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,169
and nothing to lose.

891
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,077
But it'll be dangerous going
after Slim all by yourself.

892
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,706
Hey, I got the rabbit.

893
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,684
That's not all you got, Maggie.
You got us.

894
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,210
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

895
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,849
We are sticking to our plan
and going home.

896
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,052
Hold on, you two.

897
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:47,496
As strange as this sounds,
Grace is actually making sense.

898
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,726
- Thank you.
- You want the money...

899
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,666
and I want to get even
with Slim.

900
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,829
The three of us go together,
and we're sure to get him.

901
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,671
Once you collect the reward,
I'll walk out your front gate...

902
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,041
and I'll stay out of it forever.
Deal?

903
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:07,372
Your powers of persuasion
are uncanny. Deal.

904
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,944
Ha! Bovine bounty hunters!
Now I've seen everything.

905
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,851
Let's get moving, ladies.

906
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:18,351
Time for an underground
smackdown. Yee-haw!

907
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,263
<i>Out in the land where
the heroes meet their makers</i>

908
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:26,258
<i>Out in the land where
the hale and hearty fall</i>

909
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,100
<i>Out where the fearless
get the shudders</i>

910
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,538
<i>Justice is here,
and it's wearing udders</i>

911
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,838
<i>Yee-haw!
The cows are walkin' tall</i>

912
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,503
<i>Home, home,
this ain't it, pal</i>

913
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,307
<i>Home, home,
home on the range</i>

914
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,541
<i>Home, home,
better go git, pal</i>

915
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,346
<i>Home, home,
home on the range</i>

916
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,548
<i>OK, boys, let's go
through it one last time.</i>

917
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,080
- Who am I?
- Uncle Slim?

918
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,093
Correct! Heh.

919
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,652
Now, I put on my hat...

920
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,631
then I put on my spectacles...

921
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,726
- Aah! Hey! Who're you?
- Where's Uncle Slim?

922
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,068
Ohh! It's still me!

923
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,232
Can't you stupid
sack of hammers get it right?

924
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,275
Oh, the ever-punctual
Mr. Weaseley.

925
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,213
<i>OK, everybody make way...</i>

926
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,842
<i>for the big man
in black market livestock.</i>

927
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,918
- Aah!
- Hey, who're you?

928
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,896
<i>All right, come on!</i>

929
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,364
<i>Move it, Bessie, or
I'll tan your hides right here.</i>

930
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,266
I... hey, hey, hey!
Watch the suit! Watch the suit!

931
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,530
Feast your eyes.

932
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,939
5,000 cows on the barrelhead
as promised, Mr. Weaseley.

933
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,000
The name's Wesley.

934
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,136
So, Slim, what do you say
we get a move on...

935
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,046
and load these cash cows
onto the train A.S.A.P., huh?

936
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,208
Let's go.

937
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:51,118
Yes, yes, of course. Just as
soon as I finish counting. Hmm.

938
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,625
<i>Lucky Jack, you did it!
We're here!</i>

939
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,130
<i>Well,
I take my hat off to you, Jack.</i>

940
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,825
But you've got us here
in one piece.

941
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,527
Well, seein' is believin'.

942
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,627
And I don't believe what I see.

943
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,898
<i>Oh, it's Buck!</i>

944
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,906
<i>Stallion of the Cim-moron.</i>

945
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,373
I'm supposed to be here
just in case...

946
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,636
one of the horses get tired.

947
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,904
Cows only.

948
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,674
Look, friend, you don't
understand my situation.

949
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,876
No, you don't understand...

950
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,009
<i>so I'll say it again.</i>

951
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,488
<i>The only critters
that get by me are cows.</i>

952
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,922
<i>Cows only.</i>

953
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,086
Oh, come on!
Look, cut me a break.

954
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,356
Now what?

955
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,364
Aww, what are you doing here?

956
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:37,526
Ha ha! Sorry we're late.
We got separated from the herd.

957
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,535
Right this way, little lady.

958
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,230
Tell 'em Junior sent you.

959
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,966
Ohhh...

960
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,234
- Howdy, partner!
- Ahem.

961
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,732
- Nice hat, ma'am.
- Oh! Cheeky devil.

962
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,906
Excuse me, reject.
Coming through.

963
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,575
Oh! Hey, what gives?!

964
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,278
How come
they got to go through?

965
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,876
They're cows.

966
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,854
What?!
But what about the rabbit?

967
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,756
Well, obviously,
he was with the cows.

968
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,022
Ha! I'm with the cows, too!

969
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,258
Yeah! Hey! Hey, cows! W-wait up!

970
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,322
You got to tell this guy
you know me!

971
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:10,765
See, Junior, we're old friends!

972
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,931
Come on, Margie! Uh, Gretchen!
Miss, uh... uh, Hat Cow!

973
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,599
Come on,
it's your old pal Buck, see?

974
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,609
Buck... Buck...

975
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,770
Oh, Buck!

976
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,279
Nah, doesn't ring a bell.

977
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,975
No, no, no, wait!
Hey, come back! No!

978
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,678
Hang on... hang on a second.
Heh heh heh.

979
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,777
They're just kidding.
You see, if you could...

980
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,552
Oh, hey! Hey!
Hey, cows! Cows! Oof!

981
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,582
Don't make me hurt you.

982
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,287
Heh heh.

983
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,161
Rico.

984
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,136
I gotta go, but let's throw on
the old feedbag sometime.

985
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,571
Stay cool.
Ha ha ha! It's hero time.

986
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,534
So what's the plan?

987
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,443
Well, let's see...

988
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,812
You two get his attention
while I sneak up behind him...

989
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,441
and then
I'll knock him into the cart...

990
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,975
and then we'll rope him up
and wheel him to justice!

991
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,486
And for extra measure...

992
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,012
how about we conk him
on the noggin with this?

993
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,287
You go, cowgirl!
That's usin' the old hat.

994
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,886
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, you lost me here, missy.

995
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,862
Look, Jack, it's simple.

996
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:17,663
Cart, smack, rope, roll,
justice. Come on, Jack, focus.

997
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:21,159
<i>Now is not the time to get
all scatterbrained and flaky.</i>

998
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,842
Oh, good, I'm not too late.

999
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,109
Sorry. Still stakin' out
your quarry, huh?

1000
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,615
Yeah, pretty much. Why?

1001
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,608
Listen, I came to warn you, one
equine to another, about Rico.

1002
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,314
As soon as he nabs
that rustler...

1003
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,323
he's gonna be in a big hurry
to collect that reward.

1004
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,881
- So?
- So?!

1005
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,860
Once he catches his man, that's
when the horsewhip comes out...

1006
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,487
and he's not shy
about using it, either!

1007
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,997
- Horsewhip?
- Horsewhip!

1008
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,192
And not only are you
gonna be carrying Rico...

1009
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,530
but that rustler as well.

1010
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,160
Have you seen that guy?
He's huge!

1011
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,329
What should I do?

1012
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,565
- Run!
- OK.

1013
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,334
Yeah, run like the wind,
partner, and save yourself!

1014
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,500
I'm going!

1015
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,238
Go on, take off! Fade!
Ride into the sunset!

1016
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,610
- All righty, I'm outta here!
- Aah! Scram!

1017
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,342
OK, thanks, buddy!
I owe you one!

1018
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,974
Godspeed, my friend!

1019
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,076
So long, sucker! Ha ha!

1020
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,145
He must be takin' stupid lessons
from that buffalo.

1021
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,214
Uh-oh.

1022
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,317
<i>-1,420...
-4,334...</i>

1023
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,487
1,440...

1024
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:23,056
- 4,335...
- 1,435...

1025
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,227
- 1...
- 4,336...

1026
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,669
- Ohh!
- 4,337...

1027
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,570
Can't you morons
count to yourselves?

1028
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,733
Come on.

1029
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,242
Gotta start all over!

1030
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,744
- There he is.
- Come on, let's go!

1031
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,144
Hold on!

1032
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,876
You're both forgetting
Slim's hypnotic control...

1033
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,975
over those
with less than perfect pitch.

1034
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,542
Jack, I hope you can forgive me.

1035
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,885
- For what, missy? Aah!
- For that.

1036
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:46,980
Now, you watch it there, toots!

1037
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,250
Grace, how practical!

1038
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,955
Done countin'!

1039
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,693
- What do we got?
- 4,997.

1040
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,963
- What?
- Huh? Wait, wait, what?

1041
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,867
I thought you said 5,000 even.

1042
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,135
Of course I did. Gil must've
just miscounted, that's all.

1043
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,368
Huh?

1044
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,933
<i>There's one up there!</i>

1045
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,037
The others can't be far behind.

1046
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,741
<i>Just you watch.</i>

1047
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:15,239
You're gonna like this.
Yodeling's an art.

1048
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,185
Ahem.

1049
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,491
Huh?

1050
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,963
Ha ha ha!
What's the deal, Slimbo?

1051
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,601
Maybe she wasn't an art lover.

1052
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,769
Philistine!

1053
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,335
Shut up, you greenhorns!

1054
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,838
A bovine ain't been born
that can resist my charms.

1055
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,679
Ahem.

1056
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,119
Watch your back, Uncle Slim!

1057
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:03,189
Got you!
Where do you think you're going?

1058
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,696
Ooh!

1059
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,328
- Now, Jack!
- OK!

1060
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,999
What in the rootin'- tootin'
blazes is goin' on here?!

1061
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,531
Whoo-ha!

1062
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,940
Ohh!

1063
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,275
Uncle Slim! Uncle Slim!

1064
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,474
Let's get outta here!

1065
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,211
- Aah!
- Come back here, dog meat!

1066
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,946
- Jackpot!
- We got him now!

1067
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,851
- Well done!
- Watch out!

1068
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,220
It's Buck!

1069
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,724
Hey, Casey Jones...

1070
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,022
grab the bills
and fire up the getaway express!

1071
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,461
Uncle Slim! Uncle Slim!

1072
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,900
I gave up clown college
for this?

1073
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,166
Aah! Aah! Ooh! Mama!

1074
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,672
Ooh.

1075
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,108
It's Slim! I got Slim!
Rico's gonna be so proud of me!

1076
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,805
Thank you!

1077
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,212
Whoa! Whoa! Ooh! Leave me alone!

1078
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,216
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1079
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,083
Aah!

1080
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,387
Yaaah-hoo-hoo-hooey!

1081
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,224
- Sorry.
- Uncle Slim! Uncle Slim!

1082
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,822
- Quick, girls, in here!
- Ooh!

1083
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,991
Ooh!

1084
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,894
Hey!

1085
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,104
Huh?

1086
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,502
That was Rico!

1087
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,009
What in blue blazes?

1088
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,040
Ohh!

1089
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,646
<i>I'll knock you
into next Tuesday!</i>

1090
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,350
<i>Come back here!</i>

1091
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,052
- Whoa! Whoa!
- You're going down!

1092
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,719
Junior! Junior!

1093
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,286
- Oh! Whoa!
- Junior!

1094
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,696
Junio-o-or! Whoo-hah!

1095
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,133
- Get this off of me!
- Uncle Slim! Uncle Slim!

1096
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,140
Rico's saddle!
I'm wearing Rico's saddle!

1097
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,476
Aah!

1098
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,746
Aaah!

1099
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,411
- Uncle Slim! Oof!
- Ohh!

1100
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,714
- Surprise!
- Oof!

1101
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,744
- Aah! Eee!
- Aah! Dang!

1102
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,405
Oof! Oof! Oof! Aah! Unh!

1103
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,744
We made it, girls!
We made it!

1104
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,409
<i>- Three cheers!
- Hip-hip-hooray!</i>

1105
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,282
Ladies, we got company!

1106
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,121
Ohh... oh!

1107
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,958
Aaah! Aah!

1108
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,620
Whoa! Stop! Stop! Hit the brake!

1109
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,459
Look out!

1110
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,111
Yaah! Dagnabit!

1111
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:10,279
I guess I gotta do everything
around here myself!

1112
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:18,656
Call me crazy, but I think
these cows got it in for me.

1113
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,027
Maybe they just don't like
your singing.

1114
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,895
Shut up! Ahem.

1115
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,459
Mr. Weaseley,
my money, if you please.

1116
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,301
Heh heh heh. I was just
keeping it safe for you, Slim.

1117
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,465
Sure you were.

1118
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,034
<i>Protecting my investments
is what I pay this fellow for.</i>

1119
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,874
Mr. Weaseley, let me present...

1120
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,211
the most traitorous,
double-crossin' gun for hire...

1121
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:43,549
<i>that I've ever had the pleasure
to call partner... Rico.</i>

1122
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,952
You're too kind, boss.

1123
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,889
No, it can't be.

1124
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:51,018
His reputation as
a bounty hunter is well-known...

1125
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,893
but lately he's been doing
a little moonlighting...

1126
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,795
and covering my tracks.

1127
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,460
Rico's going to see you
to the border...

1128
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,096
so that nothing else goes wrong.

1129
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,197
Tck-tck.

1130
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,868
Now, if you'll all pardon me...

1131
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,140
there's
a little Patch of Heaven...

1132
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,169
on the auction block
this morning.

1133
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,843
He's going to buy our farm!

1134
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,547
Adios! Yee-haw!

1135
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:21,148
I don't know
how you got here, skittish...

1136
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,283
but stick with me,
and you may get to like...

1137
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,590
the other side of the law.

1138
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,960
Get on there! Hyah!

1139
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,521
<i>All right, come on! Come on!</i>

1140
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,864
<i>Move it, Bessie! Get in there!</i>

1141
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,766
Hurry up!
You don't want to be late...

1142
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,202
for that big round-up
in the sky!

1143
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:41,369
Hah! Skittish, whoa!

1144
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,538
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1145
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,448
Get in there!
Come on, you stupid cows!

1146
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,711
Come on!

1147
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,413
Unh!

1148
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,615
<i>Lovely.
Now get the engine fired up...</i>

1149
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,055
<i>and let's make tracks.</i>

1150
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,490
Huh?

1151
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,053
<i>Make a break for it,
ladies! Run!</i>

1152
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,622
Whoa! Hah! Skittish, whoa!

1153
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,759
Buck, have you gone crazy?!

1154
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,828
Now, that's entirely possible!
Yo!

1155
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,308
Or maybe I just figured out
who the real heroes are!

1156
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,971
Wait! What if this is
some kind of trick?

1157
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,480
Whoo! Whassah!

1158
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,678
Oh, this isn't a trick!
It's a miracle! Come on!

1159
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,620
So you think
you got the drop on me...

1160
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,624
well, think again! Hyah!

1161
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,627
Oh!

1162
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,925
Whassah!

1163
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,194
- Whoo!
- Unh...

1164
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,566
This is useless.

1165
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:43,129
Let's put our heads together.
More brains and less brawn.

1166
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,662
All right!

1167
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,438
Grr!

1168
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,712
OK, Caloway, fetch!

1169
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,648
- Kaboosh!
- Hyah!

1170
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,227
Oof! Unh!

1171
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,394
Ha! Lucky shot!

1172
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,132
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?

1173
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,975
Uh... ha...

1174
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,603
Wow! Bravo!

1175
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,875
Bravo! You stopped Rico cold!

1176
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,246
Aw, shucks. T'weren't nothin'.

1177
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,683
Fat lot of good it done us.

1178
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:32,847
Alameda Slim
has already flown the coop.

1179
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,151
She's right.

1180
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,717
Unless we sprout wings, we'll
never make it back in time.

1181
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,523
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

1182
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:42,759
This train
goes right by Patch of Heaven.

1183
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,097
What is in the cud
you've been chewin'?

1184
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,932
How are we supposed
to drive that thing?

1185
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,565
How? How? I'll tell you how!

1186
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,940
The same way we walked off
the farm into the unknown.

1187
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:58,572
The same way we fought off
those burly barmaids.

1188
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:02,641
And the same way we braved
the western wilderness...

1189
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,620
without the benefit
of food or water.

1190
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:10,649
We caught Slim once,
and we shall do it again!

1191
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,092
Who's with me?

1192
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:18,597
Get out of here, you bulls!
Head for the hills! Whoo!

1193
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,274
Unh!

1194
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:30,908
- Let's get it on!
- Cows rule!

1195
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,245
<i>Howdy, darlin'! Down here!</i>

1196
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,308
Yeah! Look... look down!
Hello there!

1197
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,478
Oh, no!

1198
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,957
I got two words for you guys...
cold shower!

1199
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,050
We don't have time
for this nonsense!

1200
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,492
We have a farm to save!

1201
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,827
- Well, maybe we can help you.
- Maybe we can help each... oof!

1202
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,629
- Other!
- Ohh!

1203
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,033
Bye!
Come up and see us sometime!

1204
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,230
Grace!

1205
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:08,339
Oh, no!
It's the Morning Express!

1206
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,851
There's a switch up ahead!

1207
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,480
Way ahead of you, pops!
Hop on!

1208
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,650
- Come on, mule!
- Let's ride!

1209
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,793
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

1210
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,124
Ha! Ha!

1211
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,972
- Whoa!
- Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

1212
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,202
Aah!

1213
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,638
Roadhogs!

1214
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,176
Aah!

1215
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,345
See you back at the farm, girls!

1216
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,684
<i>Good luck!</i>

1217
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,689
This happens all the time.

1218
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,987
Sold!
All property and livestock...

1219
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,655
formerly known as
Patch of Heaven...

1220
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:57,757
is hereby sold
to Mr. Yancy O'Del.

1221
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,429
Pleasure doing business
with you. Heh heh heh.

1222
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,837
O'Del's the name,
foreclosure's the game.

1223
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,638
Well,
just set yourself over yonder.

1224
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:12,080
Sign this deed,
and the property is all yours.

1225
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,672
<i>Much obliged, sheriff.</i>

1226
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,344
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

1227
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,216
- There it is!
- Home and hearth!

1228
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,524
And a holy hallelujah
of a curve!

1229
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,530
- Oh, quick, the brakes!
- No time for that!

1230
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:31,533
- But won't we jump the tracks?
- We are makin' our own tracks!

1231
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,000
This is going to be messy!

1232
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:44,846
Hee hee hee! The whole territory
belongs to me. Huh?

1233
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,576
Five cents for these chicks.

1234
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,585
Come on, now,
do I hear two cents?

1235
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:50,881
- Behind you!
- B-behind you!

1236
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,219
Whoa! Whoa! Hold your britches!
Come on, now!

1237
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,225
Whoa! Run for your lives!

1238
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,256
Watch yourself!

1239
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:09,703
What's the idea of crashing
your train on my property?

1240
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,229
What? Uh...

1241
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,299
It can't be!

1242
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,749
Hold it right there!

1243
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:33,990
Piggies, it's time to open up
a can of whoop-hide!

1244
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,057
Unh! Who the... Oof! Ow! Aah!

1245
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,732
Oh! Get away from there! Aah!

1246
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,405
Owww!

1247
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:51,243
Oh, come on! Ow! Oof!

1248
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,977
You wanna get nuts?
Let's get nuts!

1249
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,143
Ow! Aah!

1250
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,184
Aaah!

1251
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,985
Ohhhh! Oof!

1252
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,586
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1253
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,326
It's Alameda Slim!

1254
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,425
You think you've won?

1255
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,562
It ain't over
till the fat man sings!

1256
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,614
Alameda Slim,
you're under arrest.

1257
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:38,187
Nobody messes
with Pearl's girls!

1258
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,559
- Say, girls, got milk?
- Buck!

1259
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:41,722
Just kidding.

1260
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:47,232
Take him away, boys!
Hope you like stripes.

1261
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:51,069
Pearl, your cows can't do much
with Slim's reward money.

1262
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,870
<i>Think you can find
some use for it?</i>

1263
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,877
Whoo-eee! My farm is saved!

1264
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,037
Awww!

1265
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,248
Where's Maggie?

1266
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,656
I can't believe she just left.

1267
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,931
I'm gonna miss her.

1268
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,562
So shall I, Grace.

1269
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,267
Her brash manner,
her bullheadedness.

1270
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:29,676
She risked her life for us,
and who are we but strangers?

1271
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:34,206
We were privileged to know her.
She was a cow like no other!

1272
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:38,016
Right down to her appalling
bodily eruptions.

1273
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,712
- Ahh, that was good!
- Maggie!

1274
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,123
I was just having
one for the road...

1275
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,957
when I heard
all the nice stuff...

1276
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,963
you guys were saying about me.

1277
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,693
You know, maybe I could
hang around a while.

1278
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,701
- How about forever?
- Oh!

1279
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,829
Hmm.
Well, it's your call, Caloway.

1280
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,738
Is this barnyard big enough
for the both of us?

1281
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,039
Only if you let me wear the hat.

1282
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,069
Yee-haw!

1283
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,308
Come on, move your hides, girls.

1284
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,942
Last one to the barn
sleeps standing up!

1285
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,282
Awww.

1286
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,352
OK, everyone, big smiles!

1287
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,884
<i>"So it was that Alameda Slim...</i>

1288
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,486
<i>"the most notorious
and feared cattle rustler...</i>

1289
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:24,227
<i>was apprehended and unmasked
by three unusual dairy cows. "</i>

1290
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,426
Hey! Dagnabit, Jeb!

1291
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,595
How many times I got to tell you
to wait your turn?

1292
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,399
How many times
have I got to tell you...

1293
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,928
to get out of my barrel...

1294
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,600
Hey, dagnabit! You ornery ol'...

1295
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:37,442
It's so nice that Jeb
finally found a friend.

1296
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,947
Here they come, everybody!

1297
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,759
- Well done!
- Ha ha ha!

1298
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,263
Well, hi ho, ladies!

1299
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,165
Hey, Barry, three queens,
two kings, hmm?

1300
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,828
Full house.

1301
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,033
And the joker is wild.

1302
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,007
Oh, yeah.

1303
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,210
<i>Darlin', I swear</i>

1304
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,512
<i>Once you been there</i>

1305
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,711
<i>There ain't a view
beneath the blue</i>

1306
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:17,980
<i>That could ever compare</i>

1307
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,612
Hyah! Ho-haa!

1308
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,680
<i>The only thing missing</i>

1309
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,454
<i>Is you as my guest</i>

1310
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,395
<i>On a little Patch of Heaven
way out west</i>

1311
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,092
<i>Why don't you come visit?</i>

1312
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,660
<i>There's room in the nest</i>

1313
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,170
Yee-haw!

1314
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,173
<i>On that little
Patch of Heaven</i>

1315
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:47,548
<i>Way out west</i>

1316
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,814
<i>Come with me</i>

1317
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:24,614
<i>Let's go wander</i>

1318
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,952
<i>Far beyond
the wild blue yonder</i>

1319
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,359
<i>Out where stars roam free</i>

1320
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:37,421
<i>Though the journey's
far from breezy</i>

1321
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,924
<i>Stick with me,
I'll make it easy</i>

1322
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,771
<i>You can depend on me</i>

1323
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:52,407
<i>Yeah, there's
a long road before us</i>

1324
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:58,751
<i>And it's a hard road,
indeed</i>

1325
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:02,814
<i>But, darlin', I swear</i>

1326
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,827
<i>I'll get us there</i>

1327
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:12,892
<i>Wherever
the trail may lead</i>

1328
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,393
<i>Once we cross
that far horizon</i>

1329
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,703
<i>Life
is bound to be surprisin'</i>

1330
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:25,681
<i>But we'll take it
day by day</i>

1331
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:29,115
<i>Never mind
the wind and weather</i>

1332
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,746
<i>If we walk that trail
together</i>

1333
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:37,487
<i>Somehow we'll find our way</i>

1334
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:44,489
<i>Yeah, there's a long road
before us</i>

1335
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:50,904
<i>And it's a hard road,
indeed</i>

1336
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,807
<i>But, darlin', I vow</i>

1337
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:58,176
<i>We'll get through somehow</i>

1338
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:04,209
<i>Wherever
the trail may lead</i>

1339
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,916
<i>Can't tell you
when we'll be there</i>

1340
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:11,016
<i>It may take all our lives</i>

1341
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:16,965
<i>We're headed for
that great unknown</i>

1342
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,095
<i>We'll soon be walking free
there</i>

1343
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,900
<i>Till that day arrives</i>

1344
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:29,935
<i>At least we won't be
travelin' alone</i>

1345
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:36,281
<i>And there's
a long road before us</i>

1346
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:43,190
<i>And it's a hard road,
indeed</i>

1347
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:47,127
<i>But, darlin', don't fear</i>

1348
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:50,723
<i>'Cause I'll be right here</i>

1349
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:56,295
<i>To give you
the strength you need</i>

1350
01:12:56,338 --> 01:13:00,604
<i>And through the whole ride</i>

1351
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:06,877
<i>I'll be by your side</i>

1352
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:16,916
<i>Wherever the trail
may lead</i>

1353
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:36,507
<i>La la la la</i>

1354
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:46,279
<i>La la la</i>

1355
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,516
<i>When you're sad</i>

1356
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,685
<i>When you're feeling low</i>

1357
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,422
<i>When you're hurt</i>

1358
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,522
<i>And don't know where to go</i>

1359
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,897
<i>Think of me</i>

1360
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,402
<i>There I'll be</i>

1361
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:06,204
<i>Anytime you need a friend</i>

1362
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,903
<i>When you're down</i>

1363
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:12,209
<i>And your luck runs out</i>

1364
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:16,547
<i>Or if you're in trouble
or in doubt</i>

1365
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,419
<i>It's OK</i>

1366
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,389
<i>Turn my way</i>

1367
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:26,087
<i>Anytime you need a friend</i>

1368
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,392
<i>When you're scared</i>

1369
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,955
<i>I will stay with you</i>

1370
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,900
<i>When you feel
you're fallin'</i>

1371
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,336
