1
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,827
That one.

2
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,958
Here, boy.

3
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,547
You're heavy.

4
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,968
And slobbery.

5
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:24,684
There.

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,354
You're a good boy.

7
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,024
You're my good boy.

8
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,158
Hello?

9
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,663
Penny, I don't have much time.

10
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,541
Daddy?
Are you okay?

11
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,336
Something's come up at work, honey.

12
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,047
Daddy's not gonna be home for a while.

13
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,175
I don't understand.

14
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,178
You can't go back
to the house, Penny. Okay?

15
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,098
What's happening?

16
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,936
It's all right.
You won't be alone. You have Bolt.

17
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,439
I've altered him.

18
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:36,006
He can protect you now.

19
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,736
The doctor has been taken care of,
which, of course, is wonderful news.

20
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,780
Everything is positioning nicely.

21
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,492
There he is. Dr Calico.

22
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,914
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

23
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:15,837
Oh! His guts will spill,
one way or another.

24
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,839
Never! I'll never talk.

25
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,092
Daddy!

26
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:26,681
You're beginning to irk me, professor.
I am irked, and that will not do.

27
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,267
Has the package arrived?

28
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:34,689
I think it might make our dear friend
a bit more communicative.

29
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,025
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

30
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:42,030
Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me
on the first flight.

31
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,379
Bolt, let's go.

32
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,991
We only need the girl.

33
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,193
What?

34
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,530
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

35
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,785
Bolivia! Bolivia!
Calico's in Bolivia!

36
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,787
Near Lake Rogaguado!

37
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,541
Lake Rogaguado! I should've known.

38
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,884
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

39
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,328
Bolivia.
There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

40
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,176
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

41
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,480
Bolt, fetch.

42
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,749
Puppy!

43
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:44,082
Good boy.

44
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,501
Airport.

45
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,470
Bolt, speak.

46
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,221
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

47
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,891
Mission accomplished.

48
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,146
That's a keeper.

49
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,400
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

50
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,574
Don't worry, Bolt.
You saved the day again.

51
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,079
All right. Good job.
Let's strike the set.

52
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,835
We're gonna need a cable guard on set
for that move tomorrow.

53
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,545
Yeah. All right.

54
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,008
Good boy.

55
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:19,427
Airport.

56
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,270
Bolt, speak.

57
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,025
- Boom mike.
- We got a boom mike.

58
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,776
It's a boom mike.

59
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,280
That's sloppy.

60
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:43,117
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

61
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,621
Who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?

62
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,956
What? Who's that?

63
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,668
Forgive me for answering a question
with a question,

64
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,880
but who are you?

65
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,759
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

66
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,971
Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network,

67
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,973
what do you see here?

68
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,770
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

69
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:15,983
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

70
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,653
Am I missing something?

71
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,572
You're missing everything, Mindy.

72
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,574
You see a dog.

73
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:29,914
I see an animal who believes with
every fibre of his being, every fibre,

74
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,667
that the girl he loves is
in mortal danger.

75
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,835
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

76
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,173
the likes of which has never
been captured on screen before!

77
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,009
Never, Mindy from the network!

78
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:48,182
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

79
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,602
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

80
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:56,691
and it's why we most certainly
do not let the dog see boom mikes!

81
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,196
Because, Mindy from the network,

82
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:10,329
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

83
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,375
Okay.

84
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:18,546
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

85
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,049
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

86
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:23,467
There's always a happy ending.

87
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,971
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-35-year-olds are unhappy.

88
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,723
They're not happy with happy.

89
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,725
So maybe you should, I don't know,

90
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,561
spend a little less time
worrying about the dog's Method acting

91
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,729
and more time figuring out

92
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,315
how to stop 20-year-olds in Topeka
from changing the channel.

93
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,234
Because if you lose
so much as half a rating point,

94
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,572
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

95
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,241
How's that for real?

96
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,496
There. Perfect.

97
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,083
You saved me again, Bolt.

98
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,423
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

99
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,093
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

100
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,435
You got them, Bolt.
No one's gonna hurt me.

101
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,773
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

102
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,110
Come here, buddy. Come here.

103
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,781
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

104
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,785
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

105
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,288
Well, what do we have here?

106
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:38,459
Your old buddy, Mr Carrot.

107
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:01,774
Bolt. You know I have to go.

108
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,125
Yeah, you're my good boy.

109
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:30,261
There she is. My little superstar.

110
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,513
Let's get to that Teen Vogue
cover shoot.

111
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,683
Mom, I wanna take Bolt home
this weekend.

112
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,184
Well, I...

113
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,186
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

114
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:44,108
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

115
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:49,655
So I can bring Bolt home?

116
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,492
As your friend I say, "Yes, absolutely,"

117
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,289
but as your agent, I have to remind you
this is Bolt's world.

118
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,959
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

119
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,211
But he never gets to be a real dog,

120
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,297
and it would only be for the weekend,
and I just want...

121
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,966
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

122
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,303
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.
Boop! Pin in.

123
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,555
There you go.
Now, let's let that hang there a bit,

124
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,640
and then we'll address that
when we've thought things through.

125
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,309
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

126
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:20,478
Smiles all around?
Let's get out of here. Come on.

127
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,064
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

128
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,817
Look at this face.

129
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,320
I have a little girl at home,
love of my life.

130
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,739
I would do anything for her,

131
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,742
and I would trade her for you
in a heartbeat.

132
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,911
True story.

133
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,580
That reminds me,
we need to be getting over to wardrobe.

134
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,831
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

135
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,000
- I need her in hair.
- I just...

136
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:44,752
Can I get her for five minutes
in makeup?

137
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,588
I wanna go for something more natural.

138
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,930
So the dog thinks this is all real?

139
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,765
Oh, yeah, you're new.

140
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,518
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

141
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,438
Whenever I get the chance,
this is the perfect way to unwind.

142
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,859
I like to start with an evil laugh.

143
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,698
Hello, hairballs.

144
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,785
You may have won today, Bolt,

145
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,122
but in the end,
we will get your little Penny.

146
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,793
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

147
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:30,297
Ultimately, it will destroy you,
along with your fiendish puppet master!

148
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,759
I know, right?
Okay, watch this.

149
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,471
She's a goner, dog.

150
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,725
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

151
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:49,733
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

152
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,320
I would superbark you both
back into the hole you crawled out of,

153
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,823
but I need you alive
because I've got a little message

154
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,325
for you to take back
to your Green-Eyed Man.

155
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,744
You tell him
his old friend Bolt said he better...

156
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,162
Is it long?

157
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,999
- Is what long?
- The message.

158
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,669
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

159
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,005
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

160
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,173
You know what? Why don't we do this?

161
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,509
You remember
the first half of the message,

162
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,344
and then I'll remember the second,

163
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,513
and then we can pass it on
to the Green-Eyed Man together.

164
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,433
Now, I don't care how
the message is translated, all right?

165
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:23,934
Just do it, okay.

166
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,353
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

167
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,274
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

168
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,525
You tell the Green-Eyed Man
that reckoning...

169
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,612
Way too many words.

170
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,032
I was, like, "What?"
And then I was, like, "Huh?"

171
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:42,369
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

172
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,538
Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao.

173
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,042
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

174
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:53,297
Get back here,
you sick, revolting, loathsome little...

175
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,303
Dogs.

176
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,722
Cats.

177
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,982
I'll never let them get you, Penny.

178
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,752
Are you ready, Bolt?

179
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:40,761
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

180
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,845
And driver.

181
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,107
Thanks, Larry.

182
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:54,775
All right, Scooter.

183
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,444
Find the grate.
Ready on the rubber bars.

184
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,867
And track with them.

185
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,789
The Calico supercomputer.

186
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:13,961
If we can access it, we'll finally learn
where they're keeping my father.

187
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,440
The weapon's hot.

188
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,609
Heat vision time.

189
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,571
Bolt, stare.

190
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:41,822
Now!

191
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,503
Nice move.

192
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,132
Come on. Come on.

193
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:07,598
Such devotion.
It brings tears to my eyes.

194
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,016
Calico.

195
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:15,355
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organisation.

196
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:22,613
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

197
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,199
Bolt!

198
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,454
World domination is within my grasp!

199
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,552
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

200
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:48,555
You ask for
unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds,

201
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:53,727
I give you unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds.

202
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:56,647
Bolt! It's okay, Bolt. I'm fine.

203
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,233
Guards, stop her!

204
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,652
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

205
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,404
Listen to him.
He needs to know I'm okay.

206
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,573
Nope, you're not okay.

207
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:09,660
You've been kidnapped
by the fiendish Dr Calico,

208
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,745
at least
that's what the dog needs to think,

209
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,331
but just imagine,
close your eyes and imagine

210
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,418
how excited he'll be
when he saves you tomorrow. Okay?

211
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,671
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

212
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,589
- Please, just let me...
- What...

213
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:24,925
Wait a second,
what's that behind your ear?

214
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,385
Is that a...

215
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,763
Yes, it is.
It's a pin. Let's do this.

216
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,600
Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation. Boop!

217
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,352
And we will not take it down,
no, ma'am,

218
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:37,104
until this matter is resolved.

219
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,356
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

220
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,776
The DVD release junket.
Let's get going. It's a big push.

221
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,612
I want to go with a modern look,
something that says,

222
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:47,781
"I'm 13, and I'm fine with that."

223
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:52,119
All right, okay. Let's give her
some air. Let's not crowd the talent.

224
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,213
I've been working on my evil laugh.

225
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,381
'Cause everybody has an evil laugh.

226
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,301
Like that.

227
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,636
Okay, here's the thing.
You're not ready for the evil laugh.

228
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,389
You could do a chuckle,
like a mildly upset chuckle,

229
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:13,974
after my evil laugh.

230
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,058
Listen to mine.

231
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,394
Hey, Bolt.

232
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,438
Big fan!

233
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,274
Bolt! Come back!

234
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,404
I'm too late.

235
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,449
- Bolt! Help!
- I'm coming, Penny!

236
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:32,993
Bolt! Help!

237
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:37,664
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

238
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,836
Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!

239
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,098
Penny!

240
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,697
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

241
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:45,232
Okay! Hey! Hey!

242
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,576
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

243
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,211
The Green-Eyed Man.

244
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,782
Penny! Penny!

245
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,306
Penny!

246
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,809
Target acquired.

247
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,074
It ends here.

248
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,003
Penny!

249
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,006
Penny? They moved her.

250
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,180
There's no time
for formalities, brothers.

251
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:41,598
My person's in danger, and I...

252
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,435
- What are you doing?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

253
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:46,770
You wanna sniff mine first?

254
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:47,938
What?

255
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:49,105
Not from around here, are you?

256
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,650
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

257
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,821
Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie?

258
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,531
Hey! Wait!

259
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,056
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

260
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,226
Oh, buddy.

261
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,731
You got your head stuck pretty good,
huh, guy?

262
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,650
Hey, guys, come here.

263
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:36,570
Check this out.
He's got his melon stuck.

264
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,407
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

265
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,912
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

266
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:49,583
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

267
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:57,215
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this.
Turn and pull. Turn and pull.

268
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,343
Forget about it. You'll be out, no time.

269
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:16,026
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

270
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:24,284
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

271
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,953
This has the Green-Eyed Man
written all over it.

272
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,039
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

273
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:32,042
You know, I gotta say something,

274
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,877
if I could say something here.

275
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:37,380
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

276
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:41,134
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

277
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,889
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

279
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:47,057
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

280
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:49,559
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

281
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,644
Listen, listen!

282
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,314
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

283
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,735
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

284
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:01,821
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

285
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,163
No, I don't know. I thought I knew.

286
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,000
Hey, you ever hang out down on
14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?

287
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,085
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,587
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

289
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,216
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridonculous.

290
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,842
Absolutely ridonculous.

291
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,761
Capisce, ridonculous.
You know what that means?

292
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,681
You pigeons are useless.

293
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,935
I need someone on the inside,
someone close to the Green-Eyed Man.

294
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,812
A cat.

295
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,272
Ooh. A cat?

296
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,024
Yeah, a cat.

297
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,610
And when I find him, when I find him,

298
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

299
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:49,369
I think we know just the cat.

300
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,043
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

301
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,880
Okay, Saul, nice work.

302
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,882
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

303
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,719
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

304
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:11,558
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

305
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,351
Good day, Mittens.

306
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,062
Louie?

307
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,523
What is this?

308
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:23,153
It was a slow week.
That's half of what I got.

309
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,199
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

310
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,827
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

311
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:35,498
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

312
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,500
Not the claws! Please.

313
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,919
I'm holding these bad boys back,
best I can,

314
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,089
but, thing is, it's not up to me.

315
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,675
The stomach's got a direct line
to these babies

316
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,095
and I'm picking up a lot of chatter.

317
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,765
So, I'll talk to the claws,

318
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,935
but in exchange,
next week all your food comes to me.

319
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,354
But that's not our deal.

320
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,108
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

321
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:05,779
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

322
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,448
Mark my words, Mittens.

323
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,951
One day
someone's gonna stand up to you.

324
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,621
Someone's gonna teach you a lesson.

325
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,289
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

326
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,958
You should be!

327
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,460
Okay! Yeah!

328
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:21,628
Where is she?

329
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,132
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

330
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:28,301
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

331
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:30,637
Look, buddy, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

332
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:35,975
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.

333
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,644
Tell the dog, make him happy.

334
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,313
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

335
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,652
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

336
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,823
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

337
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,826
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

338
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,246
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

339
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:00,500
Looks like we're gonna do this
the hard way.

340
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,754
Hey, you're crazy, man!

341
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,259
Hey, Joey. Did we go too far in this?

342
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:13,263
You kidding?
This is the best day of my life.

343
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,848
You work for the men in black,

344
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,599
who work for the man
with the green eye.

345
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,270
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

346
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:24,858
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

347
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,944
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk!

348
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:31,614
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

349
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,618
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

350
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,036
Blue eyes?

351
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,957
Green! Yes, green! The one green eye!

352
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:45,962
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

353
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,383
I know. It's disgusting. I disgust myself.

354
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,136
Hollywood.

355
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:57,724
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

356
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:12,322
You know, I hope you
appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

357
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,075
Every bone
in my evil cat body is telling me

358
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,204
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

359
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:26,586
Okay. This is a top, top secret map
of the entire Earth.

360
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,342
Now we're over here,
by the green lady with the big torch,

361
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:34,844
and my boss has Penny locked up...

362
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:41,768
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

363
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,938
Now all you need to do
is get from here to there.

364
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:51,694
Well, I told you where to find her so
if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

365
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,447
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

366
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:58,534
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal.
We had a deal!

367
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,536
Your deal just expired.

368
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:04,040
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago.

369
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:05,959
The irony.

370
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,466
Perfect.

371
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:20,807
Padlocked.

372
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,897
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked
claws under these mitts.

373
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:32,151
Do not, I beg of you, do not make me
bring out these bad boys.

374
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:33,987
It gets ugly.

375
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,408
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

376
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:42,745
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

377
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,248
Now I'm concerned
on a number of levels.

378
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,416
- Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

379
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,583
- Watch it, though. Ow!
- You got it?

380
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,919
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

381
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,672
You're scraping the fur off my...

382
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:57,510
Oh, boy. This thing is heavy.

383
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,930
Hey, hey. Put it down.
I forgot the keys.

384
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:04,642
I'll be right back.

385
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,944
Hey, lucky penny!

386
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,864
Thanks! Now move your butt.

387
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,033
- Okay. Up on your end.
- All right, just a little bit.

388
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,117
Like that? A little bit more.

389
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,535
Yeah. I got... No, I got mine.

390
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,953
You got it?

391
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,466
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey.

392
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,302
Bobby, you guys are looking at me like,
"He don't know."

393
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:42,555
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

394
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,391
Hey, you'll remember it tonight
when you're preening.

395
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:47,727
Right, that's what'll happen.

396
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,921
I have got some good news.

397
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,672
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

398
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:20,843
I just booked you
on The Tonight Show, lead guest.

399
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,011
That's right.

400
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:28,267
Which means just absolutely nothing
if Bolt is still missing.

401
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:30,686
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

402
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,606
The Tonight Show, who cares?
I don't care.

403
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:36,442
It's okay, baby.

404
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,279
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

405
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:44,617
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

406
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,122
I bet Bolt would want you
to do The Tonight Show.

407
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:54,293
Or maybe not.

408
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,633
Bolt loves you very much, sweetie,
and you're here.

409
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,137
He couldn't have gone far.

410
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:14,230
So, if you got superpowers,

411
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:18,067
I guess that would make you,
what, like, some kind of superdog?

412
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,485
That information's classified.

413
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:22,321
Come on.
Like, what's your best power?

414
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,158
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

415
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:30,163
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

416
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,665
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

417
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,333
What's it to me?

418
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,170
I have a superbark.

419
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,922
A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me.

420
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,345
What exactly
does one do with a superbark?

421
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,849
I really can't talk about it. It's classified.

422
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,685
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

423
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:56,939
You're awfully attached
to this Penny character, huh, Wags?

424
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,526
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

425
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:04,947
And if you ask me,
the only good person is a...

426
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:12,330
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

427
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,708
Tuck and what?

428
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,892
What?

429
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:36,562
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

430
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:38,648
It's called blood, hero.

431
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,068
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

432
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,488
So if you wanna keep it
inside your body, where it belongs,

433
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:49,242
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

434
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,245
Yeah, well, normally,
I'm a tad more indestructible.

435
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,412
Must've been the...

436
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,250
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

437
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,002
What are you doing? Put that down!

438
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,922
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

439
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:06,926
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

440
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:09,595
I'm gonna seriously wound you
with this Styrofoam.

441
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:12,682
Are you mad?
You don't know the power of Styrofoam.

442
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,433
Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

443
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,104
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

444
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,733
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

445
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,739
That's a weird place to put a piano.

446
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,619
Are we gonna have
any more problems, cat?

447
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:37,290
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

448
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,796
- What is that?
- What?

449
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,548
That! Okay.

450
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,467
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

451
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,886
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

452
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,139
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

453
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,223
I can't think straight.

454
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,892
I don't believe this. You're hungry.

455
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,397
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

456
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,403
There's your antidote.

457
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,405
Food.

458
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,240
All right, who wants burgers?

459
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,075
- I'll take one.
- Me, too!

460
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,660
What's this?

461
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,997
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

462
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,666
You know, beg.

463
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,170
Do the dog face.

464
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,256
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

465
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,760
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth
who doesn't know how to beg.

466
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,848
Okay, if you want the... The antidote,

467
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,684
you're gonna have to do
exactly what I say.

468
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,437
No. Not likely.

469
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,190
You're a degenerate creature
of darkness.

470
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,525
Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said,

471
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,944
all I'm asking you to do
is just tilt your head a little.

472
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,530
You can do that, can't you? Come on.

473
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:54,867
More. More.

474
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:56,535
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

475
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,704
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

476
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,039
Oh, boy.

477
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,709
Okay. Try it the other way.

478
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,212
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

479
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:12,051
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

480
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,387
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

481
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:19,392
Hold it. Right there.
And ever so slightly, look up.

482
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,395
Soup is on, baby!

483
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,575
Here you go!

484
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,702
Yes!

485
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,668
Look at the little guy.

486
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,924
Beat it, stupid cat!

487
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:01,183
Why do you care?

488
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,602
I want to know what really happened...

489
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:05,020
And why does that matter to you?

490
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,522
Because I'm involved!

491
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:08,357
- With Ridge?
- With James!

492
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,276
If you and James were
romantic, I wanna know about it.

493
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:12,027
What, so you can...

494
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,737
Come on down!

495
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,531
Gilligan, why don't you stop that.

496
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:18,367
Come on, no Whammies!
No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!

497
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,703
For weather
on the ones, here's Lester.

498
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:21,954
It really does help,

499
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,540
and it really releases
the serotonin, and...

500
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:27,543
Hey, man,
this time we'll do it my way.

501
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,385
Well, hello, puppy.

502
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,722
Did you come for some of Grandma's
butter bean dumplings?

503
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:42,224
You wait right there.

504
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,894
One of these days,
I'm gonna pound y'all to the ground.

505
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:46,979
No more Mr Nice Guy.

506
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:53,903
Look at you.
You are quite the little actor, huh?

507
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:56,405
I haven't eaten like this in ages.

508
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,575
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

509
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:02,578
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

510
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:05,581
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

511
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:10,252
Every week new RVs bring us
new suckers who bring us new food.

512
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,671
Look around! It's perfect.

513
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:20,095
Do my eyes deceive me?

514
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,140
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

515
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,436
Or could it be my hero?

516
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,438
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

517
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:36,445
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

518
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:43,285
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

519
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've established that. Who are you?

520
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:49,375
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

521
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:51,961
Well, you know,
my ancestry isn't all hamster.

522
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:55,965
I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know,
a little wolverine in there somewhere,

523
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,800
but that's besides the point.

524
00:43:57,884 --> 00:44:02,721
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

525
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,057
He can outrun speeding missiles

526
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:08,477
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

527
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:13,899
Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

528
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,902
Wait a minute.
You've seen the superbark?

529
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:19,071
Have you been observing me?

530
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:23,492
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

531
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,994
Oh, it's nothing, really.

532
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:26,996
But I'm always so vigilant.

533
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,916
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

534
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,254
If you say so. Hey, check it out.

535
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:42,761
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh? It's like we're twins.

536
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:45,764
Yeah. Scary.

537
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,517
So, where's Penny?

538
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,769
She was kidnapped
by the Green-Eyed Man.

539
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:55,274
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

540
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,611
Grave danger. I know.
But I've captured this cat.

541
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:02,281
An agent of the Green-Eyed Man,
I presume?

542
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:05,451
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

543
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:11,123
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

544
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,961
Penny's the most wonderful person
ever, and she loves Bolt.

545
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,798
And he's awesome,
and you're a monster!

546
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:24,053
How dare you disrupt their relationship
with your evil!

547
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,472
Die! Die!

548
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,058
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

549
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:32,603
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

550
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,814
You're right. We need her alive.

551
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:38,901
- "We"?
- Yes!

552
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:42,488
Bolt, I can be a valuable addition
to your team.

553
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,573
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

554
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:49,328
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

555
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,165
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

556
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:55,834
The road'll be rough.

557
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,086
I have a ball.

558
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,504
There's no turning back.

559
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,589
Guess I'll have to roll with the punches.

560
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,508
Easy won't be part of the equation.

561
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:03,592
Promise?

562
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,261
I gotta warn you.
Going into the belly of the beast,

563
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,680
danger at every turn.

564
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,015
I eat danger for breakfast.

565
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,350
You hungry?

566
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:13,852
Starving!

567
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:14,937
Welcome aboard!

568
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,108
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

569
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,027
I don't know what's going on here,

570
00:46:22,153 --> 00:46:26,782
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

571
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:28,534
My limit is one.

572
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,702
He's coming with us.

573
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,036
But I...

574
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,371
Hey!

575
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:34,623
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

576
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,669
I agree. Now,
we need to find a fast set of wheels.

577
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,506
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

578
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:58,397
Okay. So what we do here is
we give the target a quick flyover,

579
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:01,233
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead centre.

580
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,985
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

581
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,446
Just the knowledge that every minute
spent in your company

582
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,865
becomes the new greatest minute
of my life.

583
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:10,659
No! Forget it!
How do you say

584
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,036
"No way I'm doing this" in crazy?

585
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,788
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

586
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:16,123
That's the problem!

587
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,418
Would you relax?

588
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:23,338
Every time he did this on the magic box
it was awesome.

589
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,718
Magic what?

590
00:47:27,802 --> 00:47:30,554
You know,
the magic box people stare at.

591
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:33,599
Wait a minute. Does this magic box
have moving pictures on it?

592
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,185
Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best.

593
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:40,355
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

594
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,649
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

595
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,486
Let it begin. Let it begin. Let it begin!

596
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,279
Wait! You are not a superhero...

597
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,165
What are you doing?

598
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,557
Mittens!

599
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,018
Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive!

600
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:20,813
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

601
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,023
Take my paw. I'll save you.

602
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:25,776
No, you won't! You're not really a...

603
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,127
Bolt!

604
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:48,048
Saboteur.

605
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,136
You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

606
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,639
Help him? Yeah, right.

607
00:48:57,016 --> 00:48:59,685
Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her!

608
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,572
I can't hold it.

609
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,619
Let go, you monster!

610
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,912
Bolt!

611
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,612
The real world hurts, doesn't it?

612
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,281
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

613
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:57,075
Get down here, cat.
We don't have time for this.

614
00:49:57,201 --> 00:49:58,785
I'll get a ladder.

615
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:04,666
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

616
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:10,714
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

617
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:12,132
That's preposterous.

618
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:13,300
Think about it, Bolt.

619
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:15,969
Since you got lost, none of your powers
are working, are they?

620
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:18,972
For the first time, you're hungry,
you're bleeding.

621
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:22,059
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

622
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:25,896
in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?

623
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,315
It's my mark of power, cat.

624
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:30,525
It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog.

625
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,236
You're ridiculous. Now get down here.

626
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,114
No.

627
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,993
Mittens, so help me,
I will superbark you out of that tree.

628
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,330
Yeah. Go nuts.
Let's see how that works out for you.

629
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:45,499
You leave me no choice.

630
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,680
Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

631
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,518
It's not true. It's just not true.

632
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,483
That one felt really super.

633
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,694
Wait. No, it didn't.

634
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:19,533
Okay, okay. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

635
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:25,831
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop.
I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's...

636
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:31,878
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

637
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,841
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

638
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:37,801
Bolt!

639
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:39,219
Come here!

640
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:15,338
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

641
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,465
Bolt!

642
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:19,426
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

643
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,391
That is not Bolt.

644
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,854
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

645
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:35,400
You know, when I was little,
I wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

646
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:38,153
but my parents got me
a baseball glove.

647
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:40,322
So, you know what I did?

648
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:44,951
I pretended that baseball glove
was a bicycle,

649
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:48,038
and I rode it to school every day.

650
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:49,748
True story.

651
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:52,125
It's not him.

652
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:54,086
I think it's him. I do.

653
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,841
Thank you. Look, kid.
It's time we were honest with you.

654
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,011
If we don't get back into production,
people are going to lose their jobs.

655
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,805
Good people, with families.

656
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,306
But Bolt's still out there, and...

657
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:08,058
Now, we feel for you,

658
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:10,310
and the last thing we wanna do
is ask a little girl

659
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:13,772
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

660
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,816
We need you to move on.

661
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,444
We need you to let Bolt go.

662
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:49,182
Must be made of Styrofoam.

663
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,436
No, no! No, no, no, please, please,
it can't end like this!

664
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,565
Stop worrying, cat!
I'll get us out of here.

665
00:53:56,649 --> 00:54:00,986
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

666
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,447
And no heat vision.

667
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,032
Listen to me, okay?

668
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,078
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

669
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,373
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

670
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:18,086
The ones that look like you, Bolt.
But the rest of us never come back out.

671
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,006
I said I'll get us out of here, all right?

672
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,017
My hero.

673
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,036
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

674
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:54,915
I've been expecting your call.

675
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,619
Would you give it up already?

676
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:35,872
You're liquefying
whatever brains you have left.

677
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:42,462
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

678
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,098
I did it! I'm back!

679
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,434
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

680
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,561
Fully awesome!

681
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:02,607
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

682
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:05,777
Rhino? What are you doing here?

683
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,488
Oh, nothing.
I was enjoying an evening stroll

684
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:12,492
and thought I'd just pop the hatch
on that containment unit.

685
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,121
You opened the door?

686
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,956
Yes, I did!

687
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:24,337
That's great, Rhino.
Yeah, that's really good.

688
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:27,632
All right.
Let's go get the prisoner back.

689
00:56:43,816 --> 00:56:45,317
I can't do it.

690
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,988
What did you say?

691
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:51,781
I can't.

692
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:53,992
Who are you?

693
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:56,202
Rhino, you just don't under...

694
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,788
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

695
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,916
Who singlehandedly destroyed
the Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?

696
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,043
Me, but...

697
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:08,298
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

698
00:57:08,382 --> 00:57:10,967
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

699
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,054
You! You can, Bolt,

700
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,139
because all over this planet,

701
00:57:16,223 --> 00:57:19,225
there are animals
who feel like they can't.

702
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:25,899
Like a little hamster who once spent
his days in an RV park,

703
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,528
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

704
00:57:30,654 --> 00:57:36,743
and be told, "You did it.
You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."

705
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:39,579
They need a hero, Bolt.

706
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:43,875
Someone who, no matter
what the odds, will do what's right.

707
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:48,254
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

708
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:52,842
can become possible if you're awesome!

709
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,764
Well,
you're right about one thing, Rhino.

710
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,683
Mittens does need a hero,

711
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:04,187
and I guess I'll have to do.

712
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:09,192
Such modesty!
Now, who's going to save that cat?

713
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:11,277
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

714
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,445
Me.

715
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,616
I'll get my ball.

716
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:33,716
Over there.

717
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,929
There it is.

718
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:47,605
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

719
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,234
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

720
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:54,612
We're gonna have to do things
a little differently.

721
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,324
Stealth mode.

722
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:04,164
Good night, Ester.

723
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,915
Good night, Lloyd.

724
00:59:12,506 --> 00:59:13,673
Lloyd?

725
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:19,053
Lloyd Spoon,
you jump out and scare me,

726
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,806
and I'm gonna pepper-spray you again!

727
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:28,813
I swear, it's like I work with toddlers.

728
00:59:32,776 --> 00:59:35,028
Threat nullified.

729
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,783
I feel alive.

730
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,166
There's a guard.

731
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,834
I'll snap his neck.

732
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,878
We need to get him away
from that door.

733
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,430
- Ball?
- Ball?

734
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:06,351
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

735
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:12,232
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

736
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,037
Mittens?

737
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:31,417
Bolt? What are you doing here?

738
01:00:31,752 --> 01:00:33,336
I'm busting you out.

739
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,882
You came all the way back here for me?

740
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:39,092
Yeah.

741
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:42,262
But how'd you... I mean,
you don't have any superpowers.

742
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,930
- I know.
- Really?

743
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:47,183
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

744
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,728
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

745
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:52,689
- No.
- Me neither.

746
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:59,654
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?

747
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:02,282
Hey, wait.
Where'd you get that hamster?

748
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,117
Give it. Give it.

749
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,411
Hey, wait!

750
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,204
Initiating escape.

751
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,043
What the... Hey!

752
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:16,921
Lloyd! Block the door!

753
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,923
Block the door, block the door,
block the door!

754
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:20,967
Superbark. Superbark!

755
01:01:44,408 --> 01:01:49,495
Sweet Sister Frances!
What did you do to my new truck?

756
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,622
You hold on right there!

757
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,708
Golly, Ester!

758
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,795
Both you boys need serious help!

759
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:59,047
Spicy eyes!

760
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,093
We need a ride.

761
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,096
Ooh! I've got a big one. You're welcome.

762
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,947
I can't believe it.

763
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:29,160
My whole life I've wanted to see
a real live superbark.

764
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:33,998
You are legendary.

765
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:49,180
Mittens? If...

766
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,643
If I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

767
01:02:54,728 --> 01:02:56,312
I mean, what...

768
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:01,109
Ah, don't worry about it.

769
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:05,321
Being a regular dog is, like,
the greatest gig in the world. Okay?

770
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,700
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

771
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,077
A little-known cat secret.

772
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:12,912
You know why we hate dogs?

773
01:03:13,038 --> 01:03:16,207
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

774
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:20,294
But what do dogs do?

775
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,047
Slobber, sleep,
chase tails, chew shoes.

776
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,425
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

777
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,219
You know,
most dogs live in a place like this,

778
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:31,222
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

779
01:03:31,348 --> 01:03:33,891
Out of this? But... But...

780
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:35,893
And this is your dog bowl.

781
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:38,980
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

782
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:41,274
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

783
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,608
How cool is that?

784
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:47,363
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

785
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,533
It doesn't get better than that.

786
01:03:50,617 --> 01:03:54,162
You... You seem to know a lot
about these places.

787
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,289
Yeah, I did my time in one of these,

788
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,624
but I'm more of an alley cat at heart,
you know?

789
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,919
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

790
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:09,302
Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome!

791
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,804
He's... He's beyond awesome!

792
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,599
He... He's be-awesome!

793
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:17,059
He's...

794
01:04:17,811 --> 01:04:20,938
I am be-awesome.

795
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:31,908
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece de résistance.

796
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,536
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

797
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,455
- Why?
- Just do it.

798
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:46,130
This... This is awesome!

799
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:49,759
And stick your tongue out.

800
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:57,308
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

801
01:04:57,434 --> 01:05:00,019
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

838
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:20,177
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

839
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,390
Come on. I've got a surprise for you.

840
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:31,188
Okay, okay. No peeking.
All right, now, open them.

841
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,069
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

842
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,947
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

843
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:44,869
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

844
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:46,579
Mittens, I...

845
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:48,914
I found this really soft pillow thing
for you.

846
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,251
And get this. I found some Styrofoam,
and I stuffed it inside,

847
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:54,170
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

848
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:55,337
You know what I mean?

849
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,672
Mittens, I don't think that...

850
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:02,094
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

851
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,429
Yeah, well, I don't think that I...

852
01:09:03,555 --> 01:09:05,598
Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof.

853
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,601
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

854
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,146
What?

855
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,732
We're one waffle away from Penny.

856
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,402
You're still going back to her?

857
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,739
Mittens, she's my person.

858
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,911
Ear, ear.

859
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:32,416
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

860
01:09:33,293 --> 01:09:35,419
Now, how about this? Is that real?

861
01:09:36,004 --> 01:09:40,299
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

862
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:44,845
How about that, Bolt? She's an actress.

863
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:47,473
She's just pretending.

864
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,141
Not Penny.

865
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:53,062
There is no Penny. She's fake.

866
01:09:53,146 --> 01:09:54,647
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

867
01:09:55,315 --> 01:09:58,359
No, no, Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?

868
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:01,862
They act like they love you.
They act like they'll be there forever,

869
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,907
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

870
01:10:04,991 --> 01:10:07,159
and take their love with them,

871
01:10:07,285 --> 01:10:10,830
and leave their declawed cat behind
to fend for herself!

872
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:22,800
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

873
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:26,679
I...

874
01:10:29,015 --> 01:10:30,975
I'm sorry, Mittens,

875
01:10:33,186 --> 01:10:35,062
but Penny is different.

876
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,024
Then go.

877
01:10:41,194 --> 01:10:43,863
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

878
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:47,241
I never should've taken pity on you.

879
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:50,995
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

880
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:02,006
You take care, Mittens.

881
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:42,588
That meat lover's pizza
is not loving me back at all.

882
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:45,799
Hey there, Rhino.

883
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,468
Morning, cat.

884
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,262
Where's Bolt?

885
01:11:50,805 --> 01:11:52,056
He's...

886
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:55,351
He's gone.

887
01:11:55,435 --> 01:11:57,227
Bolt left?

888
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:02,107
Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you

889
01:12:02,233 --> 01:12:06,737
that he had to face
the Green-Eyed Man alone.

890
01:12:11,743 --> 01:12:14,203
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

891
01:12:14,287 --> 01:12:16,622
But he doesn't need us any more.

892
01:12:17,248 --> 01:12:20,584
Trust me,
I've seen it a million times before.

893
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,795
In the cold, dark night before the battle,

894
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:27,299
when the steely fangs of evil
are sharpened and poised to strike,

895
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:30,928
the hero must go
and face his greatest challenge alone.

896
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,473
But if Bolt's taught me anything,

897
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:38,352
it's that you never abandon a friend
in a time of need.

898
01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:42,022
When your teammate's in trouble,
you go.

899
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,900
Whether they ask or not, you go,

900
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,027
not knowing if you're coming back
dead or alive...

901
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,196
He went the other way.

902
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,322
You go!

903
01:12:50,448 --> 01:12:54,451
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to pierce your hide, you go.

904
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:19,476
Penny.

905
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:25,941
No way. Wow. Bolt.
I'm a really big fan of yours, brother.

906
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,693
I'm Blake.
This is my writing partner, Tom.

907
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:29,194
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

908
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,821
Oh, no.

909
01:13:30,905 --> 01:13:32,865
And this is our personal assistant, Billy,

910
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,700
who was supposed
to wait up on the wire.

911
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:36,243
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

912
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:37,786
and there's something
I've always wanted to tell you

913
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,204
if I ever got a chance to meet you,
and now it's...

914
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,040
Okay, Billy, that was horrifying,
what you just did.

915
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,207
Why don't you make yourself useful.

916
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,376
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

917
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,378
Whole wheat is not the same thing
as whole grain, Billy!

918
01:13:46,504 --> 01:13:48,213
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

919
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:49,590
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

920
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:51,967
Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going.

921
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,178
I know. I know you're a busy dog,
but if you've got a second,

922
01:13:54,262 --> 01:13:55,971
we'd love to pitch you an idea
for your show.

923
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,307
Tom's better at pitching.
I'll let him take it from here.

924
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,225
Tommy's got the spotlight.

925
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,688
Wait for it.

926
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:08,776
- Aliens.
- Oh, snap!

927
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,945
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

928
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,323
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

929
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:16,116
You can't touch us.

930
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,287
I love it. But I'll tell you what.

931
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:24,625
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

932
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:28,962
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

933
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,089
We got a nibble.

934
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:33,300
Don't freak out.
This is how you blew it with Nemo.

935
01:14:33,384 --> 01:14:36,887
We open, exterior, outer space,
late morning...

936
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,057
...a fiery comet to reveal Penny...

937
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:42,726
...faced by a man-eating squid!

938
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:55,280
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

939
01:14:55,406 --> 01:14:56,782
we fade to black.

940
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:59,243
And we have a great pop song
for the end credits.

941
01:14:59,327 --> 01:15:01,787
Talk to your people.
We're ready to move on this.

942
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:03,497
He's so on board!

943
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,757
There it is!

944
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:20,264
The most terrifying place on Earth.

945
01:15:34,946 --> 01:15:36,655
Hello.
How are you doing today?

946
01:15:36,781 --> 01:15:38,991
Hi. I'm here to see Joe Mateo.

947
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:45,497
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

948
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:49,501
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

949
01:15:49,627 --> 01:15:51,128
Rhino! Hold up!

950
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:54,047
Hold up!

951
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,842
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

952
01:15:57,635 --> 01:16:02,431
Listen, this may be
really hard for you to understand,

953
01:16:02,515 --> 01:16:05,517
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

954
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:08,353
I mean, sometimes, sometimes
you think something's really real

955
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:09,855
and it's not. And sometimes...

956
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:13,317
All of my training has prepared me
for this moment.

957
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:14,610
This is complicated.

958
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:16,695
Die! Die!

959
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,700
Prepare yourself,
foul man-beast,

960
01:16:21,826 --> 01:16:24,703
for I will beat your pancreas
with your spleen,

961
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:26,997
and then I will rip your liver
out of your...

962
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,544
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

963
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,756
I had a hamster just like you
when I was a kid.

964
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,425
His name was Mr Sparkles.

965
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,245
Bolt?

966
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:11,750
Bolt! You're okay!

967
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:15,128
You came back.

968
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,640
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

969
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:41,571
You're my good boy.

970
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:08,223
Good boy.

971
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:12,144
Okay, people. Let's move it
to stage seven and do it for real.

972
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:20,986
I miss him.

973
01:18:21,112 --> 01:18:24,614
I know, honey. I do, too.

974
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:29,953
First positions, please.

975
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:43,383
Okay, hold still for me, sweetie.

976
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,814
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

977
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,816
And action.

978
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:16,124
Professor, I'd like to thank you
for granting us access

979
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:20,378
to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

980
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:23,090
You know I'd never do such a thing.

981
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:29,638
Unless it was the only way
to save your little girl's life!

982
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:30,889
Penny!

983
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:34,309
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

984
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:37,187
Your dog is nowhere near...

985
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,069
Get that dog!

986
01:19:48,699 --> 01:19:52,702
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy. Come here.

987
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:02,045
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

988
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:10,053
Hey, Wags.

989
01:20:11,722 --> 01:20:14,808
Mittens? What are you doing here?

990
01:20:14,892 --> 01:20:16,101
Long story short,

991
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:20,105
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

992
01:20:20,231 --> 01:20:21,857
But that is not important now.

993
01:20:21,941 --> 01:20:25,527
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

994
01:20:25,611 --> 01:20:28,238
And why aren't you in there?

995
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,658
You were right about her, Mittens.

996
01:20:33,077 --> 01:20:36,621
She... Well, it wasn't real.

997
01:20:36,956 --> 01:20:40,458
No, Bolt. It is real.
I was in there just now.

998
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:44,296
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenhearted.

999
01:20:45,923 --> 01:20:48,967
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you.

1000
01:20:50,803 --> 01:20:55,432
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

1001
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:01,646
Bolt, you're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

1002
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:03,690
Mittens, be quiet.

1003
01:21:03,774 --> 01:21:05,108
No. You need to hear this.

1004
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,277
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

1005
01:21:08,654 --> 01:21:10,030
What is it?

1006
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:12,824
Penny.

1007
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:16,161
Help! Please, help! Help!

1008
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:17,495
Hold on!

1009
01:21:18,998 --> 01:21:20,790
Please! Help!

1010
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:37,724
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

1011
01:21:37,808 --> 01:21:39,893
Yeah. You better run.

1012
01:21:43,314 --> 01:21:44,648
I'm on your six.

1013
01:21:44,732 --> 01:21:45,774
What do we do?

1014
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:48,568
Just make sure
I get inside that building.

1015
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:52,072
Bolt?

1016
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:55,742
Is anyone still in there?

1017
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:57,369
I don't know.

1018
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:01,873
Coming through.

1019
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,505
It's a good day to die!

1020
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:10,548
Not on my watch, rodent.

1021
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:40,870
Bolt!

1022
01:22:54,885 --> 01:22:56,803
I knew you'd come back.

1023
01:23:18,242 --> 01:23:20,410
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

1024
01:23:55,988 --> 01:23:57,197
Bolt.

1025
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:02,452
Bolt, just go on out.

1026
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:05,622
Go.

1027
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,167
It'll be okay.

1028
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:19,719
You're my good boy.

1029
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,806
I love you.

1030
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,653
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

1031
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,976
Hey, did you hear that?

1032
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,102
- Yeah.
- What is that?

1033
01:25:09,186 --> 01:25:11,229
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

1034
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:20,488
It's the superbark!

1035
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,284
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

1036
01:25:24,368 --> 01:25:26,411
Come on, let's go!

1037
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:42,302
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

1038
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:50,226
All right, we got an RT coming
through, people. Make a hole!

1039
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:51,644
For your own safety,

1040
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:54,105
keep moving away from the building.

1041
01:26:00,112 --> 01:26:02,614
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

1042
01:26:03,657 --> 01:26:07,744
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

1043
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:12,123
She's stable, but we're gonna
take her to the hospital just to be safe.

1044
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,092
I'm so sorry this happened.

1045
01:26:23,177 --> 01:26:25,303
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

1046
01:26:25,429 --> 01:26:29,015
No mother should ever have to go
through something like this,

1047
01:26:29,099 --> 01:26:34,687
but I promise you
we're going to make this work for us.

1048
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:39,150
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

1049
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:41,194
This is so great!

1050
01:26:45,157 --> 01:26:46,991
We quit.

1051
01:26:47,117 --> 01:26:50,370
No, no! Wait!
Let's not make any rash decisions.

1052
01:26:52,122 --> 01:26:53,122
Let's put a pin in it.

1053
01:27:05,177 --> 01:27:08,263
I'm afraid your injuries
were more severe

1054
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:10,765
than we had previously thought,
my dear.

1055
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:14,394
We had to completely reconstruct
your face.

1056
01:27:16,855 --> 01:27:18,314
Have a look.

1057
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:25,822
Well, at least Calico
won't be able to recognise me.

1058
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,661
Calico!

1059
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:45,091
Bolt!

1060
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:07,405
Aliens.

1061
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,287
That is totally unrealistic.

1062
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,290
Absolutely ridonculous.

1063
01:28:17,374 --> 01:28:20,710
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

1064
01:28:20,794 --> 01:28:24,714
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

1065
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:36,476
Hey, silly doggy.

1066
01:28:42,232 --> 01:28:45,902
That's a keeper.
You wanna go play outside?

1067
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:49,030
You wanna go play outside? Let's go!

1068
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:04,337
Does that dog look familiar?

1069
01:29:04,421 --> 01:29:08,299
Nope.
I never seen him before in my life.

1070
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,681
Come on.

1071
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:18,976
Bolt! Come on, buddy!

1072
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:23,356
There is no home
Like the one you've got

1073
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:30,279
