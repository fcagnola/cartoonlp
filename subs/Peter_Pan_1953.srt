00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,713
<i>The second star to the right</i>

3
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,589
<i>Shines in the night for you</i>

4
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,888
<i>To tell you that the dreams you plan</i>

5
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,809
<i>Really can come true</i>

6
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,228
<i>The second star to the right</i>

7
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,774
<i>Shines with a light so rare</i>

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,649
<i>And if it's Never Land you need</i>

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,778
<i>Its light will lead you there</i>

10
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,827
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

11
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,078
<i>So we'll know where you are</i>

12
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,161
<i>Gleaming in the skies above</i>

13
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,872
<i>Lead us to the land</i>

14
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:24,426
<i>We dream of</i>

15
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,847
<i>And when our journey is through</i>

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,425
<i>Each time we say</i>

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,478
<i>Good night</i>

18
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:40,435
<i>We'll thank the little star that shines</i>

19
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,697
<i>The second from</i>

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,276
<i>The right</i>

21
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,121
<i>All this has happened before.</i>

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,248
<i>And it will all happen again.</i>

23
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,332
<i>But this time it happened in London.</i>

24
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,053
<i>It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.</i>

25
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,094
<i>That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.</i>

26
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,179
<i>And Peter Pan chose
this particular house</i>

27
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,562
<i>because there were people here
who believed in him.</i>

28
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,859
<i>There was Mrs Darling.</i>

29
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,486
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

30
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,741
<i>Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.</i>

31
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,363
<i>But Mr Darling...</i>

32
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,917
Mary, unless I find my cuff links
we don't go to the party.

33
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,334
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,006
And if I can never...

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,627
<i>Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.</i>

36
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,473
<i>The boys, however, John and Michael,</i>

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,301
<i>believed Peter Pan was a real person</i>

38
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,812
<i>and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.</i>

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,935
Blast you, Peter Pan!

40
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,983
Take that! Give up, Captain Hook?
Give up?

41
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,861
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,944
Oh, no, John. It was the left hand.

43
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,579
Yes. Thank you, Wendy.

44
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,124
<i>Wendy, the eldest, not only believed,</i>

45
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,377
<i>she was the supreme
authority on Peter Pan</i>

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,375
<i>and all his marvellous adventures.</i>

47
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,129
Nana, must we always take
that nasty tonic?

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,135
<i>Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog,</i>

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,215
<i>kept her opinions to herself</i>

50
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,801
<i>and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.</i>

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,143
Take that!

52
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,488
Insolent boy! I'll slash you to ribbons!

53
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,487
And I'll cut you to pieces.

54
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,743
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

55
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,621
You'll never leave this ship alive!

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,452
Oh, yes, I will.

57
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,416
Take that!

58
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,922
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

59
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,387
Oh, no, you won't.

60
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,265
Back, back, back, you villain!

61
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,977
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

62
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,145
I got ya.

63
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,693
You didn't either.
You never touched me.

64
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,861
Take that and that! And that!

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,112
Boys, boys, less noise, please.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,948
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

67
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,659
What? Now, see here, Michael...

68
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,588
Not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

69
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,632
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,005
Have you seen my cuff...

71
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,171
Nana, for goodness sake!

72
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,716
Where are those cuff links?

73
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,516
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

74
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,978
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

75
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,151
- I don't know.
- The map then.

76
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,195
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,570
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

78
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,993
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

79
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,368
And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael.

80
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,624
This is my last clean...

81
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,999
No!

82
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,161
No!

83
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,713
George, dear,
we must hurry or we'll be...

84
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,543
- Mary, look!
- George.

85
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,504
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

86
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,806
It's not his fault. It's in the story.

87
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,181
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

88
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,060
I might have known. Wendy!

89
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,650
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

90
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,820
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

91
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,111
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,284
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

93
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,034
- But it did turn out rather nicely...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

94
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,959
Why, Father,
what have you done to your shirt?

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,498
What have I...

96
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,832
Now, George, really. It comes right off.

97
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,421
That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?

98
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,052
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

99
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,600
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are!

100
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,436
Captain Crook! Peter Pirate!

101
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,013
Peter Pan, Father.

102
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,145
Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

103
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,192
- No, Father.
- You don't understand.

104
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,944
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

105
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,240
Now, George.

106
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,410
"Now, George."

107
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,991
"Now, George!"

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,744
Well, "Now, George," will have his say!

109
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,075
Please, dear.

110
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,456
Mary, the child's growing up.

111
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,455
It's high time
she had a room of her own.

112
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,085
- Father!
- George!

113
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,667
- What?
- No!

114
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,169
I mean it!

115
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,927
Young lady, this is your last night
in the nursery.

116
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,014
And that's my last word on the matter...

117
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,699
No!

118
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,036
No!

119
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,627
Poor Nana.

120
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,929
"Poor Nana?"

121
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,883
This is the last straw!

122
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,469
Out! Out, I say!

123
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,096
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

124
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,774
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

125
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,019
Goodbye, Nana.

126
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,283
"Poor Nana." Oh, yes, "Poor Nana."

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,117
But "Poor Father?" Oh, no!

128
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,365
Blast it! Where is that rope?

129
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,664
Thank you.

130
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,467
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

131
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,012
It's nothing personal. It's just that

132
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:30,014
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're... Well, a dog.

133
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,855
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

134
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,434
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

135
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,980
But, Mother, I don't want to grow up.

136
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,367
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

137
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,238
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock."

138
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,076
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

139
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,831
Poor Nana, out there all alone.

140
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,962
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

141
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,510
She'll be all right.

142
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,180
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

143
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,100
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

144
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,724
Don't judge your father too harshly.

145
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,433
After all, he really loves you very much.

146
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,194
Don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

147
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,568
-"He?"
- Yes, Peter Pan.

148
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,653
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

149
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,412
And what's that?

150
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,077
His shadow.

151
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,453
"Shadow?"

152
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,996
Nana had it.

153
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,083
But I took it away.

154
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,131
Yes, of course.

155
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,841
Good night, dear.

156
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,436
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

157
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,764
Safe? Of course they'll be safe.
Why not?

158
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,271
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I...

159
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,194
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

160
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,524
Peter Pan... Peter Pan!

161
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,661
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

162
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,204
- But, George...
- Sound the alarm!

163
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,621
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

164
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,124
Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

165
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,963
Peter Pan indeed.

166
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,292
How can we expect the children
to grow up and be practical...

167
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,343
- George...
-...when you're as bad as they are.

168
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,262
No wonder Wendy
gets these idiotic ideas.

169
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,088
Over there, Tink, in its den.

170
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,748
Is it there?

171
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,465
Must be here somewhere.

172
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,057
Tink!

173
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,558
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

174
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,736
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

175
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,503
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

176
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,094
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

177
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,263
I do hope it isn't rumpled.

178
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,182
You look exactly
the way I thought you would.

179
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,890
A little taller perhaps. But then...

180
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,897
You can't stick it on with soap, Peter.

181
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,391
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

182
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,021
Come to think of it, I've never thought
about it, sewing shadows.

183
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,694
I knew it was your shadow
the minute I saw it.

184
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,118
I said to myself, "I'll put it away
for him until he comes back.

185
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,823
"He's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

186
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,829
After all, one can't leave
his shadow lying about

187
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,878
and not miss it sooner or later.
Don't you agree?

188
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,295
What I don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

189
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,468
She really isn't... Sit down.
It won't take long.

190
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,717
She really isn't vicious.
She's a wonderful nurse.

191
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,428
- Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

192
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,972
Yes, girls talk too...

193
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,267
Well, get on with it, girl.

194
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,689
My name is Wendy.

195
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,643
- Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

196
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,529
But how did Nana get
your shadow, Peter?

197
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,198
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

198
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,992
Well, what were you doing there?

199
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,035
I came to listen to the stories.

200
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,540
My stories? But they're all about you.

201
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,744
Of course. That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

202
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,463
The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember.

203
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,756
They're your men.

204
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,218
I'm so glad you came back tonight.

205
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,421
- I might never have seen you.
- Why?

206
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,428
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,679
Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

208
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,433
But that means no more stories.

209
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,604
No! I won't have it. Come on!

210
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,651
But where are we going?

211
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,445
To Never Land.

212
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,696
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

213
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,654
Peter, it will be so wonderful.

214
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,495
But wait. What would Mother say?

215
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,747
Mother? What's Mother?

216
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,875
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...

217
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,253
Who loves and cares for you

218
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,427
-and tells you stories.
- Good! You can be our mother.

219
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,596
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I...

220
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,718
Let me see now. I have to pack.

221
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,223
And I must leave a note when
I'll be back. I couldn't stay too long.

222
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,475
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

223
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,232
I'm so happy I---

224
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,355
I think I'll give you a kiss.

225
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,482
What's a kiss?

226
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,743
Well, I'll show you.

227
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,655
Stop! Stop it, Tink!

228
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,667
John, John, wake up! He's here.

229
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,880
Jiminy!

230
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,044
What in the world was that?

231
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,217
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

232
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,799
Hello, Peter Pan. I'm Michael.

233
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,431
And my name is John. How do you do?

234
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,514
- Hello.
- Look, a firefly.

235
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

236
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,613
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

237
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,988
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

238
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,204
Well, I think she's lovely.

239
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,039
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

240
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,291
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

241
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,372
- Peter's taking us.
-"Us?"

242
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,835
Well, of course.
I couldn't go without Michael and John.

243
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,672
I should like very much to cross swords
with real buccaneers.

244
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,382
Yes, and fight pirates too.

245
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,020
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.

246
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,347
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

247
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,146
But, Peter,
how do we get to Never Land?

248
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,812
- Fly, of course.
- Fly?

249
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,695
It's easy. All you have to do is to...

250
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,784
ls to...

251
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,865
- That's funny.
- What's the matter?

252
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,995
- Don't you know?
- Sure.

253
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,998
It's just that
I never thought about it before.

254
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,923
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

255
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,625
- Any happy, little thought?
- Any happy, little thought?

256
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,509
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

257
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,349
Yep! Watch me now. Here I go!

258
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,927
It's easier than pie.

259
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,305
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

260
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,686
He flewed!

261
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,685
Now you W-

262
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,112
I'll think of a mermaid lagoon,

263
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,778
underneath a magic moon.

264
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,035
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.

265
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,487
I think I'll be an Indian brave.

266
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,697
Now everybody try.

267
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,375
One, two, three!

268
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,496
We can fly! We can fly! We can fly!

269
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,677
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

270
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,639
All it takes is faith and trust.

271
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,146
And something I forgot. Dust!

272
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,649
- Dust?
- Dust?

273
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,397
Yep.

274
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,480
Just a little bit of pixie dust.

275
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,322
Now, think of the happiest things.

276
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,413
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

277
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,290
Look! We're rising off the floor.

278
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,253
- Jiminyl
- Oh, my! We can fly!

279
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,423
You can fly!

280
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,672
We can fly!

281
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,802
Come on, everybody. Here we go!

282
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,350
Off to Never Land!

283
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,935
<i>Think of a wonderful thought</i>

284
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,771
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

285
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,073
<i>Think of Christmas
Think of snow</i>

286
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,369
<i>Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky</i>

287
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,283
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

288
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,460
<i>Think of the happiest things</i>

289
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,254
<i>It's the same as having wings</i>

290
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,583
<i>Take the path that moonbeams make</i>

291
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:49,967
<i>If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye</i>

292
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,926
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

293
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,311
<i>Up you go with a heigh and ho</i>

294
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,605
<i>To the stars beyond the blue</i>

295
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,564
<i>There's a Never Land waiting for you</i>

296
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:08,274
<i>Where all your
happy dreams come true</i>

297
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:13,863
<i>Every dream that you dream
will come true</i>

298
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,946
Come on, Nana!

299
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,660
<i>When there's a smile in your heart</i>

300
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:25,257
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

301
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,584
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

302
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,343
<i>When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye</i>

303
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,016
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly</i>

304
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,470
<i>You can fly</i>

305
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,779
There it is, Wendy. Second star
to the right and straight on till morning.

306
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,617
<i>When there's
a smile in your heart</i>

307
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,618
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

308
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,132
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find
when you leave the world behind</i>

309
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,677
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

310
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,302
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly, you can fly</i>

311
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,306
<i>You can fly, you can fly, you can fly</i>

312
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,071
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

313
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:42,079
<i>A-rovin' over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

314
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,412
<i>It's the life of a pirate for me, oh</i>

315
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,043
<i>The life of a pirate for me</i>

316
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:55,096
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones</i>

317
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,975
<i>For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones</i>

318
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,350
<i>Oh, my good friend, Davy Jones</i>

319
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:08,234
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

320
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,152
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

321
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,531
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

322
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,953
Look out. It might go off.

323
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,453
We ought to be tending
to the business of looting ships.

324
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,502
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

325
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,625
Better hop it.

326
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,175
And tell the captain
we wants to put to sea, see?

327
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,969
Peter Pan...

328
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,558
Blast that Peter Pan!

329
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,937
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

330
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,984
But where is it?

331
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,108
Mermaid Lagoon?

332
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,232
No, we've searched that.

333
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,865
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

334
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,200
Here!

335
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,375
No. No, no, no! That's Indian terri...

336
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,166
But wait.

337
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,921
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

338
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,387
I wonder.

339
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,929
- Good morning, captain.
- I've got it!

340
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,759
Tiger Lily, Smee!

341
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,262
Tiger Lily, captain?

342
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,270
The chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

343
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,402
But will she talk, captain?

344
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,903
A little persuasion might be in order.

345
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,155
Now let me see.

346
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,487
Boiling in oil?

347
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,200
Keelhauling? Marooning?

348
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,913
<i>A pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

349
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,217
<i>You'll find adventure and sport</i>

350
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,967
<i>But live every minute
for all that is in it</i>

351
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:05,643
<i>The life of a pirate is short</i>

352
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:10,064
<i>Oh, the life...</i>

353
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,735
Now let me see, where was I?

354
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,112
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.

355
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,865
Shooting a man
in the middle of his cadenza?

356
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,997
It ain't good form, you know.

357
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,541
"Good form," Mr Smee?

358
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,418
Blast good form!

359
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,418
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

360
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:40,128
Why, captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

361
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,339
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!

362
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,509
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well,

363
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,096
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops

364
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,898
for the rest of me.

365
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,351
And he'd have had you by now, captain,

366
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,778
if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.

367
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,107
But now when he's about,
he warns ya, as ya might say,

368
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,694
with his tick-took, tick-took, tick-took

369
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,894
Smee? Smee!

370
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,321
Save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

371
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,275
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Smee!

372
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,244
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor captain.

373
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,038
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

374
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,664
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

375
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,550
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, captain, all clear.

376
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,504
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

377
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,930
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

378
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,055
Now, now, now, now, captain.
Just relax.

379
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,054
What you need is a shave.

380
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:17,392
A nice, soothing shave. There now.

381
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,604
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

382
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:25,191
<i>A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as</i> a...

383
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,823
Captain, you know, I can't help noticin'

384
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,280
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

385
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,325
<i>Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

386
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,207
The crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, captain.

387
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,505
That is, what's left of it.

388
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,296
Now, why don't we put to sea, see?
Leave Never Land.

389
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,348
Forget Peter Pan. There now!

390
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,722
<i>Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

391
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,772
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

392
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,565
Captain? Oh, dear!
I never shaved him this close before.

393
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,122
Now, don't worry, captain.
It must be somewhere about.

394
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,700
Get up, you idiot!

395
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,583
Aye, aye, sir.

396
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,588
I found it, captain. Good as new.

397
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,423
Why, you blithering blockhead!

398
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,599
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

399
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,844
Three points off the starboard bow!

400
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,725
Swoggle me eyes! It is Pan!

401
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,900
Headed this way
with some more of those scurvy brats!

402
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,193
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

403
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,192
Aye, aye, sir. Pipe up the crew.

404
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,864
All hands on deck!

405
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,867
All hands on deck!

406
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,695
All hands on deck!

407
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,540
All hands on deck!

408
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,163
Look alive, you swabs!

409
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,963
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, captain.

410
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,669
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!

411
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,804
- I've waited years for this.
- Not countin' holidays either.

412
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,887
- Double the powder, shorten the fuse!
- Shorten the powder, double the fuse!

413
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,225
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.

414
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,778
- All right, men! Range 42.
- Range 42.

415
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,199
- Elevation 65.
- Elevation 65.

416
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,948
- Three degrees west.
- Three degrees west.

417
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,699
Steady now!

418
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,406
Steady!

419
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,586
Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

420
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,834
Look, John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.

421
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,419
By Jove! And the Indian encampment!

422
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,971
Look, there's Captain Hook
and the pirates.

423
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,718
Look out!

424
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,473
Take Wendy and the boys to the island.

425
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,688
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.

426
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:11,407
Hook! Hook! You codfish! Here!

427
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:21,868
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

428
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,120
We can't keep up with you.

429
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,549
Tinker Bell! Wait!

430
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,072
$0!

431
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,744
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?

432
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,166
- You! That's who!
- I'll show you!

433
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,002
Orders from Pan?

434
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,464
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

435
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,434
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.

436
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,681
Wendy Bird?

437
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,221
Flying this way?

438
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,523
Pan's orders are... What?

439
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,774
- Smash it?
- Kick it?

440
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,523
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

441
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,236
- Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!

442
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,034
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!

443
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,205
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

444
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,428
- I see it!
- Me too!

445
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,807
Ready, aim...

446
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,229
Fire!

447
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,950
Peter, you saved my life.

448
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,793
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

449
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,834
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

450
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,633
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

451
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,432
- Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

452
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,726
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

453
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,100
Attention!

454
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,892
Well, I'm certainly proud of you.

455
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,944
You blockheads!

456
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,444
- I bring ya a mother to tell stories...
- A mother?

457
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,161
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

458
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,159
Tink said what?

459
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,082
Well, she said you said
to shoot it down!

460
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,957
Tinker Bell. Tink!

461
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,255
Come here.

462
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,834
You're charged with high treason, Tink.

463
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,590
Are you guilty or not guilty?

464
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,055
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

465
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,096
Tinker Bell!

466
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,558
I hereby banish you forever.

467
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,816
Please, not forever.

468
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,072
Well, for a week then.

469
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,865
Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

470
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,740
Peter, the mermaids?

471
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,698
- Let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

472
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,498
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

473
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,243
Personally,
I prefer to see the aborigines.

474
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,828
And the Indians too.

475
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,839
All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.

476
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,512
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

477
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,384
Forward! March!

478
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,593
Come on, bear.

479
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,932
Michael, do be careful.

480
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,514
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Blackfoot tribe.

502
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,613
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

503
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,416
- Quite savage, you know.
- Let's go get 'em.

504
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,121
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

505
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,418
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- What's stragety?

506
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,750
A plan of attack.

507
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,757
The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

508
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,875
John! Indians! Indians!

509
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,295
Let me in!

510
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,343
Remember, the Indian is cunning...

511
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,216
- Hey...
-...but not intelligent.

512
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:52,141
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise.

513
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:27,342
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

514
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,467
- That's all right, Wildcat.
- We don't mind.

515
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,219
That's okay.

516
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,849
<i>How.</i>

517
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,601
- How, chief!
- How.

518
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,901
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

519
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,776
Sometime you win.

520
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,323
Sometime we win.

521
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,778
Okay, chief. You win this time.
Now turn us loose.

522
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,331
"Turn us loose?"
You mean this is only a game?

523
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,659
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

524
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,744
When they win, they turn us loose.

525
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,376
This time, no turn 'em loose.

526
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,885
- The chief's a great spoof er.
- Me no spoof 'em.

527
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,631
Where you hide Princess Tiger Lily?

528
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,514
Tiger Lily?

529
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,514
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've never seen her.

530
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,345
- Me neither.
- Honest, we don't.

531
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,271
Heap big lie.

532
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,901
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset,

533
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,780
burn 'em at stake.

534
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,879
Just imagine, real live mermaids.

535
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,051
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Peter, I'd love to.

536
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,133
All right, come on.

537
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,394
- It's Peter.
- Hello, Peter!

538
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,598
Hello, Peter!

539
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,518
Hello, Peter!

540
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,398
Hello, girls.

541
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,324
I'm so glad to see you.

542
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,997
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

543
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,041
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

544
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,586
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand?

545
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,131
- I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

546
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,959
There I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

547
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,761
- Peter!
- Who's she?

548
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,011
Her? Oh, that's Wendy.

549
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,601
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

550
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,138
And in her nightdress too.

551
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,600
Come on, dearie. Join us for a swim.

552
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,684
- I'm not dressed for it.
- But you must!

553
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,520
- We insist!
- No, please!

554
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,982
- Too good for us?
- Peter!

555
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,080
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

556
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,878
They were just having
a little fun, weren't you?

557
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,258
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

558
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,299
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute

559
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,345
that I'm going to put up with a...

560
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,422
Hold it, Wendy.

561
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,558
Yep, it's Hook.

562
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,936
- Hook!
- Hook!

563
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,731
Quick, Wendy.

564
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,024
They've captured Tiger Lily.

565
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,043
Looks like they're headin'
for Skull Rock. Come on, Wendy.

566
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,752
Let's see what they're up to.

567
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,404
Now, me dear princess,
this is me proposition.

568
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,859
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan,

569
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,819
and I shall set you free.

570
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,785
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

571
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,955
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

572
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,333
Oh, yes. Always, captain.

573
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,963
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in

574
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,918
and then it will be too late.

575
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,723
I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, and watch the fun.

576
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,014
Fun?

577
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,926
Remember,

578
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,263
there is no path through water

579
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,973
to the happy hunting ground.

580
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,394
This is your last chance, Tiger Lily!

581
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,526
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

582
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,570
Beware, Captain Hook!

583
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,247
Beware! Beware!

584
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,169
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, captain.

585
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,956
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

586
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,676
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

587
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,901
Wendy. Watch this.

588
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,030
Mr Smee!

589
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,944
Yes, captain?

590
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:48,281
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

591
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,870
Aye, aye, sir. Release the princess...

592
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,122
But, captain...

593
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,627
Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

594
00:40:58,498 --> 00:40:59,875
Aye, aye, sir.

595
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,848
- Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

596
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,060
I told him you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

597
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,685
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

598
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,860
Just what you told me, captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

599
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,192
My orders?

600
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,693
Yes, captain. Didn't you just say to go...

601
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,277
Put her back! You blithering idiot!

602
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,579
My orders. Of all the bumbling...

603
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,783
Mr Smee!

604
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,370
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

605
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,081
Putting her back like you said, captain.

606
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,507
I said nothing of the sort!

607
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,335
But, captain, didn't you? I thought that...

608
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,513
For the last time, Mr Smee.

609
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,680
Take the princess back to her people.

610
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,183
Understand?

611
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,565
Aye, aye, sir.

612
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,859
And one more thing.

613
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,108
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew

614
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,940
to help themselves to me best rum.

615
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,700
Peter!

616
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,575
Here's your spirit, Smee!

617
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,745
Why, it's Peter Pan.

618
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,038
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, captain.

619
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,796
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

620
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,627
Watch this, Wendy.

621
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,337
Oh, Peter, do be careful.

622
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,604
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

623
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,949
Well, come on, you idiot! Blast him!

624
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,242
Right here, Mr Smee.

625
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,451
Hold it, you fool! No! No!

626
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,544
Captain?

627
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,706
How dreadful.

628
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:07,761
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear captain.

629
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,557
Captain!

630
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,467
In the back, captain?

631
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,518
Give it to him, captain!

632
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,399
Cleave him to the brisket!

633
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,920
I've got you this time, Pan.

634
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,178
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

635
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:54,724
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

636
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,638
I say, captain, do you hear something?

637
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,518
No.

638
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,066
No!

639
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,568
No!

640
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,908
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?

641
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,247
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

642
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,589
No!

643
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,883
- Smee!
- Don't go away, captain!

644
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,182
Stay right there now, sir. I'll save ya, sir.

645
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,094
Smee!

646
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,602
Smee!

647
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,279
Smee!

648
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,495
Captain! Captain!

649
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,582
Smee! Smee!

650
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,214
- Give him back!
- Smee...

651
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:14,178
Row for the ship! Row for the ship...

652
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,184
Smee!

653
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,232
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

654
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,859
Tiger Lily? Oh, Tiger Lily.

655
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,446
Help...

656
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,460
Peter. Wait for me.

657
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,202
That cursed Peter Pan.

658
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,657
Making a fool out of me.

659
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,713
Oh, my head.

660
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,768
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

661
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,221
Your hot water, Mr Smee.

662
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,524
The poor captain
has a splitting headache.

663
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,316
We mustn't annoy him.

664
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,211
Well, captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

665
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:19,178
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

666
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,597
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.

667
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,888
Captain, why don't we put to sea again?

668
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,430
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

669
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,390
Women trouble.

670
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,147
I wouldn't want this to go any farther,

671
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,480
but the cook told me
that the first mate told him

672
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:42,243
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

673
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,203
Why, you doddering imbecile, I...

674
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:53,546
Did you say Pan
has banished Tinker Bell?

675
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,498
Aye, aye, captain. He has.

676
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,255
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, captain

677
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:02,384
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

678
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,847
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, captain.

679
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,180
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

680
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,640
That's it, Smee! That's it!

681
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,900
I'm glad you agrees, captain.

682
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,899
Quick, me coat. Me best dress coat.

683
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,606
Aye, aye, sir.
The sooner we get going, the better.

684
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,160
Yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything

685
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,988
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

686
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,408
Here you are, sir. Your Sunday set.

687
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:34,166
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her,

688
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,418
the wench may chart our course

689
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:40,377
to a certain hiding place.

690
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,180
Our best hiding place is the Spanish
main, sir. I'll set our course...

691
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,845
And where do you think you are going?

692
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,265
To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

693
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:58,103
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell

694
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,905
and bring her to me.

695
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,196
Understand?

696
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,744
Aye, aye, sir.

697
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,962
<i>- How.
- How.</i>

698
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,012
What's the chief doing, John?

699
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,682
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

700
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,302
What's he saying?

701
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,891
He says, "Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

702
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,859
"Save Tiger Lily.

703
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,564
"Make big chief heap glad."

704
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,741
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad."

705
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,696
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

706
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,911
You now Little Flying Eagle.

707
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,499
Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!

708
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,251
Hurray!

709
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,835
- How wonderful!
- Hurray!

710
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:18,395
Teach 'em paleface brother
all about red man.

711
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,569
Good, this should be most enlightening.

712
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:24,193
Hey, what makes the red man red?

713
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,490
When did he first say, "Ugh?"

714
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,818
Why does he ask you, "How?"

715
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,113
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

716
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,951
<i>Why does he ask you, "How?"</i>

717
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,376
<i>Once the Injun didn't know all
the things that he know now</i>

718
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,378
<i>But the Injun he sure learn a lot</i>

719
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,459
<i>And it's all from asking how</i>

720
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,719
<i>We translate for you</i>

721
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,848
<i>Hana means what mana means
and ganda means that too</i>

722
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,813
Squaw, no dance.

723
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,440
Squaw, get 'em firewood.

724
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,614
<i>When did he first say, "Ugh?"</i>

725
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,997
<i>When did he first say, "Ugh?"</i>

726
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:24,082
<i>In the Injun book, it say
when first brave married squaw</i>

727
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:28,344
<i>He gave outwith heap big "ugh"
when he saw his mother-in-law</i>

728
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:43,523
<i>What made the red man red?</i>

729
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:47,447
<i>Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince</i>

730
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,571
<i>He kissed a maid and start to blush
and we've all been blushin' since</i>

731
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,659
<i>Now you've got it right
from the head man</i>

732
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,706
<i>The real true story of the red man</i>

733
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:02,036
<i>No matter what's been written or said</i>

734
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:08,126
<i>Now you know why the red man's red</i>

735
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,099
John!

736
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,560
Squaw take 'em papoose.

737
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,898
- Michael!
- Squaw, get 'em firewood.

738
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,072
Squaw no get 'em firewood!

739
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,404
Squaw go home.

740
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,708
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell,

741
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,544
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

742
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,274
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

743
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:15,785
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

744
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,159
I'm glad to hear that, captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

745
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,920
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear,

746
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,545
to tell Peter I bear him no ill will.

747
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,092
Pan has his faults, to be sure.

748
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,013
Bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

749
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,390
Dangerous business, that.

750
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,854
Why, rumour has it that already

751
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,937
she has come between you and Peter.

752
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,075
But what's this?

753
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,161
Tears?

754
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,330
Then it is true.

755
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:06,202
Smee. The way of a man with a maid.

756
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:10,752
Taking the best years
of her life and then

757
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,172
casting her aside

758
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,128
like an old glove!

759
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,135
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

760
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,684
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear

761
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,480
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

762
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,859
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

763
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,899
But how?

764
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,321
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

765
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,740
Sail! That's it, Smee!

766
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,748
We'll shanghai Wendy.

767
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,996
"Shanghai Wendy," captain?

768
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,873
Take her to sea with us.

769
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,832
With her gone, Peter will soon
forget this mad infatuation.

770
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,384
Come, Smee,
we must leave immediately.

771
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,585
Surround Peter's home...

772
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,636
But, captain, we...

773
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,181
We don't know where Peter Pan lives!

774
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,635
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!

775
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,646
What's that, my dear?

776
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,986
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

777
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,489
- Take this down, Smee.
-"Take this down, Smee."

778
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,696
Aye, aye, captain.

779
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,369
- Start at Pegleg Point.
-"Start at Pegleg Point."

780
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,251
Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.

781
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,547
"Blindman's Bluff."

782
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,838
Yes, yes.

783
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,887
Hop, skip and a jump
across Crocodile Creek

784
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:44,263
Then... Nor' by nor'east, one, two, three.

785
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,771
Well, get on with it... Continue, my dear.

786
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,477
I mustn't harm Peter?

787
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,489
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word

788
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,986
not to lay a finger

789
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,157
or a hook on Peter Pan.

790
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,164
Hangman's Tree.

791
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:14,964
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

792
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:19,544
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

793
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,155
<i>What makes red men red?</i>

794
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,457
Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

795
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,628
<i>How.</i>

796
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,956
- How, chief.
- How, chief, how!

797
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,587
<i>- How.
- How.</i>

798
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,964
Big chief greets little mother.

799
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:03,880
<i>How.</i>

800
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,425
Wendy, is that all you have to say?

801
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,853
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

802
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,181
- Tiger Lily?
- John!

803
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:17,526
Michael! Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

804
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,400
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

805
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,607
Go for days without sleep.

806
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,942
- But we're going home in the morning.
- Home!

807
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,245
- And...
- Wendy, we don't want to go home.

808
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:33,375
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

809
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,291
Peter, let's stop pretending
and be practical.

810
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,123
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

811
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,127
Oh, for goodness sake. Please, boys.

812
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,885
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like savages?

813
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,966
- Of course.
- But you can't.

814
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,928
You need a mother. We all do.

815
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,604
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

816
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,151
Michael, of course not! Surely,
you haven't forgotten our real mother!

817
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,651
Did she have silky ears

818
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,736
and wear a fur coat?

819
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,115
Oh, no, Michael. That was Nana.

820
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,578
I think I had a mother once.

821
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,247
What was she like?

822
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:13,873
I forget.

823
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,502
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

824
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,920
Hey, who ya shovin'?

825
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,341
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

826
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,639
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

827
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,596
Well, a mother, a real mother,

828
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,012
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

829
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,645
She's the angel voice

830
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,939
that bids you good night,

831
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,275
kisses your cheek,

832
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,650
whispers, "Sleep tight."

833
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,828
<i>Your mother</i>

834
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,328
<i>And mine</i>

835
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:00,079
<i>Your mother</i>

836
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,961
<i>And mine</i>

837
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:10,424
<i>The helping hand
that guides you along</i>

838
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,180
<i>Whether you're right</i>

839
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:18,306
<i>Whether you're wrong</i>

840
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,188
<i>Your mother</i>

841
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,396
<i>And mine</i>

842
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:31,444
<i>Your mother</i>

843
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,325
<i>And mine</i>

844
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:41,496
<i>What makes mothers
all that they are</i>

845
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,414
<i>Might as well ask</i>

846
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:48,969
<i>What makes a star</i>

847
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:57,061
<i>Ask your heart to tell you her worth</i>

848
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,309
<i>Your heart will say</i>

849
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,060
<i>Heaven on earth</i>

850
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:09,068
<i>Another word</i>

851
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:14,032
<i>For divine</i>

852
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:20,251
<i>Your mother</i>

853
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,295
<i>And mine</i>

854
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,719
I wanna see my mother.

855
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,386
Yes, Michael.

856
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,965
I propose we leave for home at once.

857
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,392
- Could I go too, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!

858
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:42,352
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

859
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,442
That is, if Peter doesn't mind.

860
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,145
Go on! Go back and grow up.

861
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,782
But I'm warning ya,
once you're grown up,

862
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,234
you can never come back.

863
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,368
Never!

864
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,533
Oh, dear.

865
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:01,116
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

866
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,293
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

867
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,796
They'll be back.

868
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,799
Peter.

869
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,516
Good bye, Peter.

870
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,528
All right, men. Take them away.

871
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:34,612
And now, Smee, to take care

872
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,194
of Master Peter Pan.

873
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:42,829
But, captain, wouldn't it be
more humane-like to slit his throat?

874
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,627
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

875
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,794
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

876
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,376
Or a hook on Peter Pan.

877
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:59,012
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

878
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,476
<i>So try the life of a thief</i>

879
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,557
<i>Just sample the life of a crook</i>

880
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,609
<i>There isn't a boy who won't enjoy</i>

881
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,608
<i>A-workin' for Captain Hook</i>

882
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,531
<i>The world's most famous crook</i>

883
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:18,577
<i>Crook, crook
Crickety crockety, crickety, crick</i>

884
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,326
<i>The croc is after Captain...</i>

885
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,749
<i>A special offer for today</i>

886
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,746
<i>I'll tell you what I'll do</i>

887
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,669
<i>All those who sign without delay</i>

888
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,214
<i>Will get a free tattoo</i>

889
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,047
<i>Why, it's like money in the bank</i>

890
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,129
<i>Come on, join up and I'll be frank</i>

891
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:41,262
<i>Unless you do, you'll walk the plank</i>

892
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:45,562
<i>The choice is up to you</i>

893
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,769
<i>You'll love the life of a thief</i>

894
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,603
<i>You'll relish the life of a crook</i>

895
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,860
<i>There's barrels of fun for everyone</i>

896
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:59,239
<i>And you'll get treasures by the ton</i>

897
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,572
<i>So come and sign the book</i>

898
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,499
<i>Join up with Captain Hook</i>

899
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,247
- Hey, l wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

900
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,170
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

901
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,422
Boys!

902
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,844
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

903
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,718
But Captain Hook
is most insistent, Wendy.

904
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,892
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

905
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,517
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

906
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,190
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

907
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,229
Peter Pan will save them.

908
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,698
Oh, captain, you did it.

909
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,652
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

910
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,035
I don't believe you are in
on our little joke.

911
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:49,414
You see, we left a present for Peter.

912
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,245
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

913
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,879
Why, I can see our little friend
at this very moment,

914
01:03:55,957 --> 01:04:00,178
reading the tender inscription.

915
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:04,766
"To Peter, with love from Wendy.

916
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,265
"Do not open till 6:00."

917
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,764
I wonder what's in it

918
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,772
<i>Could he but see within the package,</i>

919
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:19,072
<i>he would find
an ingenious little device.</i>

920
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,363
Set, so that when the clock is like this...

921
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,742
Peter Pan will be blasted

922
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,119
out of Never Land forever.

923
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,200
No!

924
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,964
But time grows short.

925
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,965
We have but 18 seconds.

926
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,965
Fifteen seconds.

927
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,052
Thirteen seconds.

928
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,470
Twelve seconds.

929
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,396
Well, I guess I can open it now.

930
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,402
Hey, Tink. Look what Wendy left.

931
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,155
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

932
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,238
Hook? A bomb?

933
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,822
Don't be ridiculous!

934
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,801
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

935
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,045
Amen.

936
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,973
Hook! It was a bomb!

937
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:35,023
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink...
Tinker Bell!

938
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,693
Tink? Tinker Bell?

939
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,360
Where are you, Tink?

940
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,535
Tink? Tinker Bell!

941
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,882
Tink. Are you all right?

942
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:04,549
Wendy? The boys?

943
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,060
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

944
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,605
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

945
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:19,685
You mean more to me
than anything in this whole world!

946
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:26,901
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

947
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,745
Captain Hook,
we will never join your crew

948
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,158
As you wish. Ladies first, me dear.

949
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:37,828
- Good bye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

950
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,915
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

951
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,755
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

952
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,336
Come on! Get along over there!

953
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,012
Get going! Don't give us no trouble!

954
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,136
Go on! Go on! Get it over with!

955
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,095
- Move along!
- The captain's waitin'!

956
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,228
Wendy!Wendy!

957
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,407
Captain, no splash.

958
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:12,908
Not a sound.

959
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,496
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

960
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,248
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

961
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:20,749
Did you hear a splash?

962
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,206
I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.

963
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,542
Mark me words. We'll all pay for this.

964
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,923
The ship is bewitched.

965
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,096
No splash, captain.

966
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:35,060
So you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

967
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,766
I'll give you a splash!

968
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,189
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

969
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:44,523
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

970
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,400
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

971
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,823
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!

972
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,650
Say your prayers, Hook.

973
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,408
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

974
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,874
I'll run him through!

975
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,285
Take that!

976
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,839
Curse this hook!

977
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,839
Come on, everybody!

978
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,011
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

979
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,019
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!

980
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,521
Get those scurvy brats!

981
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,520
After the brats, men!

982
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,677
This is no mere boy.

983
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,182
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

984
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,396
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

985
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,777
Steady, men. Steady.

986
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,488
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

987
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,616
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

988
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,036
Down, you blackguard!

989
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,945
Hurray!

990
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,544
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!

991
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,371
Yea for Bear Killer!

992
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,799
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

993
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,418
Coward? Me?

994
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:19,015
You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

995
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,889
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!

996
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,687
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!

997
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,811
I'll fight you man-to-man,
one hand behind my back.

998
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:34,109
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

999
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:38,489
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

1000
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,468
Now!

1001
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,515
Insolent youth, prepare to die!

1002
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,143
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

1003
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,395
No! I gave my word.

1004
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,863
You're mine, Hook!

1005
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,028
Cleave him to the brisket!

1006
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,873
You wouldn't do old Hook in now,
would you, lad?

1007
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:31,038
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

1008
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:35,216
Well, all right. If ya say you're a codfish.

1009
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,214
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

1010
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,299
I'm a codfish!

1011
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,100
Hurray!

1012
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:49,556
<i>Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish</i>

1013
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,516
<i>Hook is a codfish...</i>

1014
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,693
All right, Hook,

1015
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:57,363
you're free to go, and never return.

1016
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,486
Peter!

1017
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,588
Smee! Smee!

1018
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,311
Smee!

1019
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,980
Smee! Smee!

1020
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,272
Smee!

1021
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,616
Captain!

1022
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,787
Captain! Captain!

1023
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,915
Hurray!

1024
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:53,544
Hurray for Captain Pan!

1025
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,919
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!

1026
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:00,798
We're castin' off! Heave those halyards!

1027
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,969
But, Peter... That is, Captain Pan.

1028
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,549
At your service, madam.

1029
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,978
Could you tell me, sir,
where we're sailing?

1030
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,971
To London, madam.

1031
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,977
Peter.

1032
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:18,228
Michael! John! We're going home!

1033
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,530
Man the capstan!

1034
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,991
Hoist anchor!

1035
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,662
Pixie dust!

1036
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:10,121
George, I'm so glad
you changed your mind about Wendy.

1037
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,699
After all, she's still a child.

1038
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,877
Mary, you know
I never mean those things.

1039
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,128
Do I, Nana?

1040
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,384
Wendy!

1041
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,221
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

1042
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,352
- Mother, we're back!
- Back?

1043
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,150
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

1044
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,945
- Lost bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

1045
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,148
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

1046
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,280
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

1047
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,912
- "Am?l"
- Ready to grow up.

1048
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,914
Well, my dear, all in good time.

1049
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,081
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- But, Mother,

1050
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,382
it was such a wonderful adventure.

1051
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,427
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

1052
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,717
He was the most wonderful of all.

1053
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,470
- Why, even when we were kidnapped...
- Kidnapped!

1054
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,178
I knew Peter Pan would save us,
and he did.

1055
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,605
And we all called him a codfish!

1056
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,516
Captain Hook, I mean.

1057
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:24,194
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

1058
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:28,070
Mary, I'm going to bed.

1059
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:33,405
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

1060
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,870
See how well he sails the ship.

1061
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,910
George. George!

1062
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,212
Now what, Mary?

1063
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,917
Nana, did you see...

1064
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,142
You know, I have the strangest feeling
that I've seen that ship before.

1065
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,135
A long time ago,

1066
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,975
when I was very young.

1067
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:02,351
- George, dear.
- Father.

1068
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,108
<i>When there's a smile in your heart</i>

1069
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:11,989
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

1070
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,616
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

1071
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,618
<i>When you leave the world behind</i>

1072
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,327
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

1073
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:25,836
<i>You can fly</i>

1074
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:31,801
<i>You can fly</i>

1074
01:16:32,305 --> 01:17:32,837
