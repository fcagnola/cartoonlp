<i>Fun, fun, fun
And fancy-free</i>

<i>Da, da, dat
Da, da, dat, doit</i>

<i>Got no time to worry none</i>

<i>Too busy singin' in the sun
Sweet sun</i>

11
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:47,287
<i>If you should have a chronic ache</i>

12
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:49,256
<i>Pills won't make you strong</i>

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,860
<i>The only tonic you should take</i>

14
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>Is a teaspoonful of song</i>

15
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,433
<i>So if you'd really like to be</i>

16
00:00:57,434 --> 00:01:00,102
<i>Happy-go-lucky, just like me</i>

17

<i>Drown your frowns, my
friend and you will see</i>

That you'll be full of fun</i>

<i>Troubles are on the shelf</i>

00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,064
<i>He's so happy all the livelong day</i>

25
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:27,201
<i>Livin' life the simple way</i>

26
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:31,741
<i>Knowin' it's the only way to be</i>

<i>Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free</i>

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,253
<i>Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free</i>

29
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:39,858
<i>Everyone keeps askin' me</i>

30
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:42,494
<i>My recipe for livin'</i>

31
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,098
<i>It's simple as the ABC's</i>

32
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,901
<i>And hardly seems worth givin'</i>

33
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,604
<i>I've tried it out in every way</i>

34
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,175
<i>It always sees me through</i>

35
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,813
<i>It's made me what I am today</i>

36
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,248
<i>That's why I'm tellin' you</i>

37
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:02,418
- <i>I'm a happy-go-lucky fellow</i>
<i>- Ooh, doo, doo, doo</i>

38
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,788
- <i>Full of fun and fancy-free</i>

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,224
<i>You can make the whole
world seem mellow</i>

40
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,027
- <i>If you take it in your stride like me</i>
- <i>Ooh, doo, doo</i>

41
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,797
<i>Don't cross a bridge or
peek 'round the corner</i>

42
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,066
- <i>Until you're there</i>
- <i>Oh</i>

43
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,904
- <i>Just learn to smile and in a while</i>
- <i>Doo, doo</i>

44
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,774
<i>You'll find trouble's
a bubble of air</i>

45
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,711
- <i>Get a happy-go-lucky feelin'</i>
- <i>Doo</i>

46
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:25,980
- <i>Keep it and I guarantee</i>
- <i>Ooh</i>

47
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:30,018
- <i>That you'll find you'll wind
up livin' in the sun</i>
- <i>So right</i>

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,456
<i>Full of fun and fancy-free</i>

49
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,456
<i>Full of fun and fancy-free</i>

50
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,465
<i>That's the way I wanna be</i>

51
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:46,695
<i>I don't let my troubles trouble me</i>

52
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,443
<i>Now some folks like the heavy stuff</i>

53
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:53,046
<i>With titles five feet wide</i>

54
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,948
- <i>Not me, I'm always out for fun</i>
- <i>Doo, doo, doo</i>

55
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:58,352
- <i>I like the lighter side, yes, sir</i>
- <i>Hooray</i>

56
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:02,148
<i>La, da, da, dee, la,
da, da, dee</i> Uh-oh!

57
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:09,031
<i>Don't let my troubles trouble me</i>

58
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:11,868
<i>Don't cross a bridge or
peek 'round the corner</i>

59
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:14,204
<i>Until you're there</i>

60
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:16,874
<i>Just learn to smile and in a while</i>

61
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,343
<i>You'll find trouble's
a bubble of air</i>

00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:22,342
<i>Get a happy-go-lucky feelin'</i>

63
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,218
You know, you worry too much.

64
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,687
In fact, everybody
worries too much.

65
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,192
Here. Just look at
the morning paper.

66
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:35,295
Turn to any page.

67
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,800
You'll find the whole
world worryin'...

68
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,069
about some future age.

69
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,574
But why get so excited?
What's gonna be is gonna be.

70
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:48,244
The end of the world's
been comin' since 1903.

71
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,915
That's, uh, B.C., of course.

72
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,785
<i>Don't cross a bridge or
peek 'round the corner</i>

73
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,556
<i>Until you're there</i>

74
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:00,092
<i>Just learn to smile and in a while</i>

75
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,027
<i>You'll find trouble</i>

76
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,164
You bet, you'll find trouble!

77
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,333
Oh! Aah! Ohh!

78
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,242
Take it easy, son.

79
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:18,175
Why, you're just a
bundle of nerves.

80
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,621
You see? Jumpy as a cat!

81
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:26,313
Comes from always
rushin' into things.

82
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,101
Hmm! Now what have I done?

83
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,897
I guess I don't know
my own strength.

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,408
Sorry to upset you, miss.

85
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,778
Have you on your feet in a jiffy.

86
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,676
- Upsy-daisy.
- Mama!

87
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,453
Your mama isn't here, honey.

88
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:55,191
But if I can be of service,
the name is Cricket.

89
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:58,461
Uh, J. Cricket. You
can call me Jiminy.

90
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:01,398
Oops! Sorry! Ha-ha.

91
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,701
Oh. Howdy, chum.

92
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,836
Why so glum?

93
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:10,876
Say, what's the matter? You
worried about somethin' too?

94
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:15,281
Tsk, tsk. Never saw
such a dismal pair.

95
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,386
A deadpan doll and a droopy bear.

96
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:24,355
You ought to try my recipe.
Be full of fun and fancy-free.

97
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:29,364
Life is a song... happy, gay.

98
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:33,525
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?

99
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,445
"Bongo"? Now, what in
the world is Bongo?

100
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:44,049
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."

101
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,616
Well, what are we waitin' for?

102
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:51,051
<i>Da, da, doo, da</i>

103
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,372
A ringer!

104
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:06,609
It's a gift.
<i>Da, da, dee, da, la, doh</i>

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,579
<i>La, da</i>

106
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,715
Take it away, Dinah!

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,956
This is the story...

108
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:21,059
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.

109
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,630
The mama bear, the papa bear,
and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.

110
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,966
But it's not the story you expect.

111
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,636
This is a love story.

112
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:32,340
It's about a little girl bear...

113
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,910
and a big, burly,
brawny brown bear...

114
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:39,181
who wanted very much
to be her boyfriend.

115
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:43,887
But mostly, this is a
story about Bongo.

116
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,122
He was a circus bear.

117
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:50,060
He was born in the circus,
grew up in the circus.

118
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,128
In fact, Bongo was the
star of the circus.

119
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,457
In fact, Bongo was the
star of the circus.

120
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,337
Why, he could juggle and
dance while on a trapeze,

121
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:02,073
walk a tightrope with
the greatest of ease.

122
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,710
In jujitsu, he was beyond compare.

123
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,946
Once threw a bull
at the county fair.

124
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:09,382
Super at wrestling
and lifting weights.

125
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:13,315
Outboxed the champs of 1 7 states.

126
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,895
They all packed in
from near and far...

127
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:23,198
to see this death-defying star.

128
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,602
With mouths wide open,
they watched his ascent...

129
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,431
as he daringly climbed
to the top of the tent!

130
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,817
Then, for a grand climax,

131
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:43,189
he would gracefully
plunge 300 feet...

132
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,451
into a wet sponge!

133
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,480
Poor Bongo.

134
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:14,359
Naturally, you'd think he'd
be handled with kid gloves,

135
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,030
treated like a king...

136
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,165
and pampered like a baby.

137
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,835
But, no! He was tossed
around like an old shoe.

138
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:31,505
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.

139
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:38,789
His thoughts would wander
to an imaginary life...

140
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,225
far removed from the circus.

141
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:45,363
<i>Bongo, Bongo, Bongo</i>

142
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,532
<i>Bongo, Bongo, Bongo</i>

143
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:53,806
Some half-forgotten
instinct kept calling him.

144
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:58,241
For you see, Bongo was a dreamer.

145
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:12,122
Hey, Bongo! Get going! You're on!

146
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:29,515
The call of the wild kept
ringing in his ears.

147
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,743
Psst! Hey. Bongo!

148
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,593
He couldn't ignore it any longer.

149
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,962
<i>Bongo, Bongo, Bongo</i>

150
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,766
He had to answer the call
of the great open spaces.

151
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,768
Come on out, Bongo.

152
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:52,443
<i>Bongo, Bongo</i>

153
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:56,447
Come on out, Bongo.

154
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,117
Come on out, Bongo!

155
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,327
Bongo, Bongo.

156
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,662
He was crackin' up!

157
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:11,699
Bongo, Bongo!

158
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,202
- He was losin' his grip!
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!

159
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:18,574
He had to escape, to get away!
Just gotta get away!

160
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:21,677
- Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta get away! Gotta get away.

161
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:25,682
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta, gotta, gotta!

162
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,684
Bongo! Bongo!

163
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,020
Bongo! Bongo!

164
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,424
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!

165
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,958
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!

166
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,652
At last he was free.

167
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,722
Free. Free?

168
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:04,794
Oh! But this was even
better than he'd expected!

169
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:13,272
"Oh, boy, "thought
Bongo, "this is livin'!"

170
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,601
Whoo!

171
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:20,246
He felt so good, he just had
to run around... and jump.

172
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:37,226
Why, he even tried to growl.

173
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:48,102
"Oh, boy! A tree. That's for me!"

174
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,727
Just right for climbin' too.

175
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:57,429
"Oh, well. What if I can't
climb a big old tree?

176
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,299
This is still the place
for a fellow like me."

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,935
- <i>Ooh, ah, ohh</i>
- Just lazy and loafin'...

178
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,405
and fancy-free.

179
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:10,946
- <i>I love to hang around</i>
<i>- Ooh</i>

180
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:13,148
<i>The lazy countryside</i>

181
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:17,487
<i>Where things are nice and breezy</i>

182
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:21,224
<i>With nature's gang around</i>

183
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,094
<i>The lazy countryside</i>

184
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,798
<i>Where life is twice as easy</i>

185
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,034
<i>Where the crickets</i>

186
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:33,406
<i>You don't hear in the city</i>

187
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:39,146
<i>Keep a-hummin' in your ear
Oh, so pretty</i>

188
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:44,853
<i>And it's just too much for words</i>

189
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:49,157
<i>Listenin' to the
chorus of the birds</i>

190
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:52,928
<i>I like to stay around</i>

191
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:55,898
<i>The lazy countryside</i>

192
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,770
<i>And while away the hours</i>

193
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:03,307
<i>Just kind of play around</i>

194
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,178
<i>The lazy countryside</i>

195
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,848
<i>As free as bees and flowers</i>

196
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,614
<i>There's more fun in
takin' the sun in</i>

197
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:20,821
<i>And to roam the spaces wide</i>

198
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:26,495
<i>It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be</i>

199
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:31,293
<i>'Round the lazy countryside</i>

200
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:38,247
<i>There's more fun in
takin' the sun in</i>

201
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:43,452
<i>And to roam the spaces wide</i>

202
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:47,958
<i>It's the place for me</i>

203
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,264
<i>Gee, but it's great to be</i>

204
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,568
<i>'Round the lazy</i>

205
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:04,076
<i>Countryside</i>

206
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:13,789
"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,

207
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,924
"this is the stuff."

208
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,669
"To stretch out under
a canopy of stars...

209
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,432
"studding the velvet
softness of the night.

210
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:39,313
To sleep in the peace and
quiet of the woods."

211
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:49,030
The stillness of the night
descends like a sheltering veil.

212
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:53,033
Hush. All nature sleeps.

213
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:09,964
Then came the dawn.

214
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:51,381
Ohh. Bongo felt as
stiff as a board...

215
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,914
and as cranky as an old bear.

216
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:10,169
Bongo was discouraged.

217
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,274
A fine kind of bear
he'd turned out to be!

218
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:17,104
He didn't even know how
to act like a bear.

219
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,158
This rough, rugged
stuff wasn't for him.

220
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,851
Especially on an empty stomach.

221
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,501
Uh-uh.

222
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:52,244
Bongo thought, "This is
just too good to be true!

223
00:21:56,287 --> 00:22:00,424
"I... I'm either hungry
or I'm still dreamin'.

224
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:09,634
"Ow! I'm awake! It must be true.

225
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:13,772
Oh, this is much
better than dreamin'!"

226
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:08,805
"This must be heaven.
I-it can't be real!

227
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:11,676
"It's just too good to be true.

228
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:16,581
But let me go right on dreamin',
as long as I'm with you."

229
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:22,788
<i>This is too good</i>

230
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,125
<i>To be true</i>

231
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:32,934
<i>I can't believe it's real</i>

232
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:37,206
<i>Can it be you</i>

233
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:44,315
<i>I really see</i>

234
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:48,585
<i>I never knew</i>

235
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:54,748
<i>I'd find an angel</i>

236
00:23:56,195 --> 00:24:00,600
<i>And out of the blue</i>

237
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:05,873
<i>You came to me</i>

238
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:12,344
<i>You're all the heavenly things</i>

239
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:19,822
<i>That I've been dreaming of</i>

240
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,430
<i>Don't spread your wings</i>

241
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,701
<i>And fly away</i>

242
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:33,573
<i>But if you're only</i>

243
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:37,244
<i>Passing through</i>

244
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:44,119
<i>Then take me to heaven with you</i>

245
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,595
<i>Or is this a dream</i>

246
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:56,333
<i>Too good to be</i>

247
00:24:56,334 --> 00:25:02,407
<i>True</i>

248
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:08,580
<i>This is too good to be true</i>

249
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:13,083
<i>I can't believe it's real</i>

250
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:16,724
<i>Can it be you</i>

251
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,962
<i>I really see</i>

252
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:26,761
<i>I never knew I'd find an angel</i>

253
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:35,646
<i>Out of the blue you came to me</i>

254
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:40,586
<i>You're all the heavenly things</i>

255
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:45,725
<i>That I've been dreaming of</i>

256
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:48,328
<i>Don't spread your wings</i>

257
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:53,267
<i>Don't fly away</i>

258
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:58,173
<i>But if you're only</i>

259
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:02,444
<i>Passing through</i>

260
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:08,385
<i>Then take me to heaven with you</i>

261
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:13,725
<i>Or is this a dream</i>

262
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:18,331
<i>Too good to be</i>

263
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:24,870
<i>True</i>

264
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:31,644
The air grew still with a sudden chill.
No talk, no laughs, no chatter.

265
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:35,314
With the trees shaking, the ground
quaking, the crowd began to scatter.

266
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:40,146
Out of his lair came the third
bear, with murder in his eye.

267
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:46,093
He took in the scene of love
serene with jealousy and surprise.

268
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:49,230
He was the roughest,
toughest, meanest bear.

269
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:52,424
Lump jaw by name,
a villain for fair.

270
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,619
Well... what's this?

271
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:14,560
It's no dream. It's a nightmare!

272
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:18,032
"He-He-Hello,"

273
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,501
was all Bongo could say.

274
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:23,171
"Hmm. Kind of unfriendly.

275
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:26,809
Probably doesn't know who I am."

276
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:55,509
"Just a moment. This is my affair."

277
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,375
"He-He-Hello, Lulubelle, dear."

278
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:11,662
Gosh, Bongo was surprised.

279
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:16,993
Why should Lulubelle turn against him?
That was no way for a lady to act.

280
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,453
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.

281
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:34,656
All right.

282
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:38,885
She'd give Mr. Bongo
just one more chance.

283
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:47,367
"What have I done?"

284
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,833
Poor Bongo.

285
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:15,070
<i>It was too good</i>

286
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:19,109
- <i>To be true</i>
<i>- Ah</i>

287
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,547
Gone were his dreams.
His world was shattered.

288
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:27,786
Why hadn't someone ever told
him about all of these things...

289
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:30,422
that really mattered?

290
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,959
- And now,
- <i>Ah</i>

291
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,763
well, now it was just too late.

292
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:39,767
He'd never find out that
when bears are in love,

293
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:42,266
they always say it with a slap.

294
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:54,317
<i>When a bird loves a
bird he can twitter</i>

295
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:58,189
<i>When a puppy falls
in love he can yap</i>

296
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,626
<i>Every pigeon likes to coo
when he says I love you</i>

297
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:05,264
<i>But a bear likes to
say it with a slap</i>

298
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:09,001
<i>When a whippoorwill's
in love he can whipper</i>

299
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:12,539
<i>All the horses neck and
all the turtles snap</i>

300
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,143
<i>Every deer and every dove
has a way of makin' love</i>

301
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:19,447
<i>But a bear likes to
say it with a slap</i>

302
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:23,385
<i>You can ask any bear, Oh
There's nothin' to compare</i>

303
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:27,056
<i>With a love tap
Strong or weak</i>

304
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:30,694
<i>So if you're ready for romance
and you ever get the chance</i>

305
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,364
- <i>Grab your girl
- Give her your cheek</i>

306
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,003
- <i>So when love comes along Don't be silly</i>
- <i>Doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

307
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:41,674
- <i>Never ever waste your time like a sap</i>
- <i>Doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

308
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,378
<i>Let the others hug and kiss
but the bare facts are this</i>

309
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,081
<i>That a bear likes to
say it with a slap</i>

310
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:51,218
- <i>Slap, slap</i>
<i>- Give me a love tap</i>

311
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,060
<i>Grab your bears and swing 'em wide</i>

312
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,062
<i>Shake their fur and
scratch their hide</i>

313
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,064
<i>Give her a slap
Give her a cuff</i>

314
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:05,069
<i>Go 'round that floor
and strut your stuff</i>

315
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,405
<i>He slapped her once and he missed her jaw
and he wound up smackin' his mother-in-law</i>

316
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:12,110
<i>Now here comes Grandpa gettin' in
line, And here comes baby bear behind</i>

317
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:17,115
- Whoo-hoo!
<i>- Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

318
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:20,753

00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:26,883
<i>You're all the heavenly things</i>

342
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:32,891
<i>That I've been dreaming of</i>

343
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:37,430
<i>Ohh don't spread your wings</i>

344
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:42,068
<i>And fly away</i>

345
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:46,440
<i>But if you're only</i>

346
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,709
<i>Passing through</i>

347
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,916
<i>Then take me to heaven with you</i>

348
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,185
<i>Ooh</i>

349
00:36:56,186 --> 00:37:01,591
<i>Or is this a dream</i>

350
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:06,263
<i>Too good to be</i>

351
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:10,702
- <i>True</i>
<i>- Is it only a dream</i>

352
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:16,364
<i>Too good to be true</i>

353
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:25,820
Excuse me. There.

354
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:29,650
Now who says dreams
don't come true? Well!

355
00:37:32,896 --> 00:37:37,123
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.

356
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,641
" Miss Luana Patten."

357
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:45,777
Mmm! Well.

358
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:50,407
Of course, it's not cricket to
read other folks' mail, but...

359
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:54,848
"A party!

360
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,127
Tonight!" Mmm.

361
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:02,062
"The house across the way.

362
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,167
"Charlie McCarthy. Mortimer Snerd!

363
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:08,938
Edgar Bergen?" Huh.
Never heard of him.

364
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:12,743
"Please come!"
Why, I'd be delighted!

365
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:15,979
<i>Join the party
Come along</i>

366
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,950
<i>It's a cinch
Can't go wrong</i>

367
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:23,388
<i>Now's the time to see
what you can see</i>

368
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:26,892
<i>The house is just across the way</i>

369
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:29,094
<i>Better hurry
Don't delay</i>

370
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:35,880
<i>You'll be full of
fun and fancy-free</i>

371
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,650
Oh, dear. Nanny goats
and petticoats.

372
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,652
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.

373
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,723
Tell me, what is the secret
of your lovely complexion?

374
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:49,061
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.

375
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,631
Yes. If I'm not being too
personal, Ophelia...

376
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,900
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?

377
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:56,769
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?

378
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,773
- Yes.
- And how old is that?

379
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:00,876
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.

380
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,911
I thought you were a little
bit older than that.

381
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,848
Well, I knocked off a few
years for good behavior.

382
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,784
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff. Ha-ha.

383
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:10,547
Well, we're awfully glad
you came to our party.

384
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:11,967
- Well.
- Did you have fun?

385
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:17,027
Oh, yes, indeedy. I thought Charlie made a
pig of himself with that chocolate cake.

386
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:19,564
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.

387
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,065
Yes, I agree with you.

388
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,537
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.

389
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:27,974
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?

390
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:31,846
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...

391
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,948
Uh, bunny, bunny wee,
bunny wee. Bun...

392
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:39,288
Uh... uh, I don't
know no bunny wee.

393
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,823
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.

394
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,094
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?

395
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,330
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?

396
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:50,669
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!

397
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,737
Help, he...

398
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:55,507
Isn't that a wonderful trick?

399
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:59,211
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could
enjoy my first childhood...

400
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:02,014
as much as he does his second.

401
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:06,119
Now, Luana, how would you like another
piece of cake or some ice cream?

402
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,222
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?

403
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:13,662
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?

404
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,698
How about you, Mortimer?

405
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:19,202
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.

406
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:23,032
I don't mean that. Well, what shall
we do now? Any suggestions?

407
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:26,348
How would you like to go down to the
city dump and watch me slug rats?

408
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,012
- Certainly not.
- No?

409
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,014
How would you like to
hear me tell a story?

410
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:32,651
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?

411
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:36,855
Well, I, uh... y-y-yeah... no.

412
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,959
This is a story that
everyone should know.

413
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,229
Yes, but not everyone should
tell it. And you know who.

414
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,333
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago...

415
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,335
I think I'll run out
and wind a sundial.

416
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:49,371
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:52,375
Once upon a time, long, long ago...

418
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:55,244
Funny, nothing ever
happens nowadays.

419
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,547
There was a place
called Happy Valley.

420
00:40:57,548 --> 00:40:59,549
Now, it was called Happy Valley...

421
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,287
because everyone who
lived there was happy.

422
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:08,093
- No! Well, there's a hunk of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer?

423
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:12,532
- Uh, Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.

424
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:16,469
Now just try and imagine it. Can't
you just close your eyes and see it?

425
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,974
Well, I can't see very
good with my eyes closed.

426
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:21,976
My eyelids get in the way.

427
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:25,580
- You create a picture in your mind's eye.
- Oh.

428
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:29,952
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.

429
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:32,589
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.

430
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,526
I... I painted a barn once, I did.

431
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,529
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.

432
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,266
- It was... It was a red barn. It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.

433
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:43,535
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.

434
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:46,238
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.

435
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,507
Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it.

436
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:50,944
Let's see, uh... Let's see, now.

437
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:54,849
It's, uh... Oh, let's
say it's about, uh...

438
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,851
Uh, what was the question?

439
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:59,588
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

440
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:02,491
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!

441
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:05,328
Yeah.

442
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:08,327
Let's see, uh...

443
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:16,006
Oh, I'm tired. All
that work for nothin'.

444
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:18,871
- Can I try?
- Certainly.

445
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,883
Yes. I think I can
see it, Mr. Bergen.

446
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:26,220
It's beautiful.

447
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:29,256
Yes, it was one of
nature's garden spots,

448
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:32,460
nestled among the
green, rolling hills.

449
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:35,363
Can't you see the lovely brook
as it flows through the valley?

450
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,967
Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:41,470
The winding roads,
lined with stately trees.

452
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,473
Trees. Yeah.

453
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:46,911
Lush fields and prosperous
farms dot the landscape.

454
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:48,913
L-Landscape. Yeah.

455
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:51,316
And high on a hilltop
overlooking the valley,

456
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:54,620
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.

457
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,156
No, no. It was
something much nicer.

458
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,725
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.

459
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,998
And something very precious is
kept within these castle walls.

460
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,000
- <i>My</i>
- What is it?

461
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,704
It's a magic, singing harp. Listen.

462
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,741
<i>What a happy day</i>

463
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:15,978
<i>What a sunny sky, kind of
makes you sigh in a happy way</i>

464
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:18,115
<i>What a very merry day</i>

465
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:20,317
<i>All the world is gay</i>

466
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:22,419
<i>When your cares are light
and your heart takes flight</i>

467
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,456
<i>And you're swept away</i>

468
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:27,892
<i>The air is sweet with clover</i>

469
00:43:27,893 --> 00:43:30,061
<i>The clouds are turning over</i>

470
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:32,064
<i>Oh, yes
They're turning over</i>

471
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:34,100
<i>Just to show their silver lining</i>

472
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:37,672
<i>My, what a happy day</i>

473
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:39,707
<i>Never knew such bliss
Never read of this</i>

474
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,009
<i>In a book or play</i>

475
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,680
<i>What a lovely day</i>

476
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:47,149
<i>What a great big gorgeous,
sumptuous thumping, bumptious</i>

477
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,585
<i>Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious</i>

478
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:53,348
<i>My, what a happy day</i>

479
00:43:56,694 --> 00:44:01,333
<i>M-M-My, what a happy day</i>

480
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:04,437
<i>Never knew such bliss
Never read of this in a book or play</i>

481
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:06,973
<i>What a lovely day</i>

482
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:09,675
<i>What a great big gorgeous,
sumptuous thumping, bumptious</i>

483
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:12,471
<i>Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious</i>

484
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:15,782
<i>Oh, my, oh, my</i>

485
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:18,219
<i>What a happy</i>

486
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,123
<i>Day</i>

487
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:24,394
Yes, the voice of
this golden harp...

488
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,731
cast a magic spell of joy and
prosperity over the valley.

489
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:31,335
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.

490
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,604
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.

491
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:37,892
No, no. One day a mysterious
shadow crept over the valley.

492
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:41,493
And then something
dreadful happened!

493
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:48,771
Aaaaaah!

494
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:50,807
What happened?

495
00:44:50,808 --> 00:44:54,744
When the shadow lifted,
the golden harp was gone.

496
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:58,616
No longer was the valley happy,
for without the magic of the harp,

497
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:02,954
all was misery, misery, misery.

498
00:45:02,955 --> 00:45:05,190
Just like the eighth grade.

499
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,225
Desolation spread over the land.

500
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:09,494
Everything was drying up.

501
00:45:09,495 --> 00:45:11,898
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?

502
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,901
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:17,472
The fields of golden
corn turned to dust.

504
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:19,474
Kerplop.

505
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:22,667
The laughing brook flowed no more.

506
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:29,852
To think that this was
once Happy Valley!

507
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,855
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.

508
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:34,891
Days pass, weeks pass.

509
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:37,663
I pass. New deal.

510
00:45:37,664 --> 00:45:40,466
What happened to all the people?

511
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,935
Well, suppose we look in
on these humble peasants.

512
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:46,272
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.

513
00:45:46,273 --> 00:45:48,475
Well, at least they had milk.

514
00:45:48,476 --> 00:45:51,078
Well, she used to be a
good milker. But now...

515
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:53,981
She's an udder failure.

516
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:57,619
She was the bosom friend
of a once-proud family.

517
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,311
Well, they're certainly out
of the high rent district.

518
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,128
And there they are,

519
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:09,299
three poor farmers, gripped
by the pangs of starvation.

520
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,970
Still alive, still breathing,

521
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:14,639
sharing a pitiful
crust between them.

522
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,977
Share and share alike.

523
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:22,314
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.

524
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:24,651
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.

525
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:27,020
But are their spirits broken?

526
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,090
Have they lost hope?

527
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:33,996
Yes. Men facing famine,
naught left but beans.

528
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:37,266
Ahem. Bean, you mean.

529
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:40,036
If it were one man
and three beans...

530
00:46:40,037 --> 00:46:44,308
But, no. One bean and three men.

531
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:47,344
Well, at least there
are no bones in it.

532
00:46:47,345 --> 00:46:49,780
Just look at that
miserable creature,

533
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:52,551
doggedly struggling
to maintain life,

534
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:56,255
a gaunt, lean bag of
bones and feathers.

535
00:46:56,256 --> 00:46:59,593
Truly a picture of despair.

536
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:02,863
But Donald doesn't whimper.

537
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:05,934
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!

538
00:47:05,935 --> 00:47:08,603
I can't stand it!

539
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:16,236
Easy, Donald. Easy!

540
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:22,453
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.

541
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:24,890
I... I'll be all right.

542
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:27,759
Yeah. I'll be all right.

543
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,019
I'll be all right.

544
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:39,273
He says he's all
right, but I wonder.

545
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,742
He's suffered too much.

546
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:45,114
What diabolical thought is being
hatched in the fevered brain...

547
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,875
of this poor, demented duck?

548
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:52,882
Donald! No! No!

549
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,427
Nice bossy, bossy.

550
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:03,360
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!

551
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,609
Donald! No, Donald!

552
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,680
Give it here! Let me...

553
00:48:16,552 --> 00:48:21,123
I just gotta eat.

554
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:23,125
I'm so... hungry.

555
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,228
The little fellow was
completely out of his head.

556
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,730
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.

557
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:32,637
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!

558
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:36,410
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...

559
00:48:36,436 --> 00:48:37,810
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.

560
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,713
Oh, it was a sorry
predicament indeed.

561
00:48:40,714 --> 00:48:43,282
What to do? What to do?

562
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:47,735
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's
got the right idea. Kill the cow.

563
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:51,192
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow
was their best friend.

564
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:54,762
Well, a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

565
00:48:54,763 --> 00:48:57,366
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.

566
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,403
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,

567
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,740
I don't wanna hear
the rest of the story.

568
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,910
Well, she wouldn't have to know.

569
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:08,811
They could sneak up on her and
surprise her. Yeah, that's what we'll do.

570
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:11,583
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.

571
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:14,052
We'll get a stranglehold
on her while she's asleep.

572
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:18,691
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!

573
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:21,160
I ain't a-gonna
listen to the story.

574
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:24,366
Well, it'll be your fault
if they starve to death.

575
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:27,535
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.

576
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:31,040
Well, why didn't you say so in the
first place, and save a lot of time?

577
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,477
I could save a lot of time by
not telling the story at all!

578
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:37,614
Your idea is not without merit.

579
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:40,884
Well, back to the
scene of desolation.

580
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:43,053
Things are beginning to
look much brighter now,

581
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:47,158
because as Mickey goes to the village to
sell the cow, the thought of prosperity...

582
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,029
brings new hope to the
famished farmers.

583
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,600
Even Donald has fully recovered,
for soon their long-empty plates...

584
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:55,602
will overflow with food.

585
00:49:55,603 --> 00:50:00,207
Hey, look! <i>Turkey,
lobster sweet potato pie</i>

586
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:03,544
<i>Pancakes piled up 'til
they reach the sky</i>

587
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,214
<i>Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa</i>

588
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,576
<i>Oh-h-h-h</i>

589
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,554
<i>I wanna eat and eat and eat and eat</i>

590
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:13,590
<i>And eat until I die</i>

591
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:16,393
<i>Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie</i>

592
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:19,831
<i>Pancakes piled up 'til
they reach the sky</i>

593
00:50:19,832 --> 00:50:21,833
<i>Lots of starches
Lots of greens</i>

594
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:24,770
<i>Fancy chocolate-covered...</i>

595
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,474
- Beans!
- What d'you mean, beans?

596
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:31,311
Yeah, fellows. I sold the
cow for some magic beans!

597
00:50:31,312 --> 00:50:33,216
Beans!

598
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:37,820
But Donald!

599
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:41,490
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!

600
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:45,495
If you plant these beans in the light of
a full moon, do you know what'll happen?

601
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:48,732
Yes! We get more beans!

602
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:52,995
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!

603
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:56,073
Poor Mickey,

604
00:50:56,074 --> 00:50:59,177
cheated into trading his cow
for a handful of beans.

605
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:01,980
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!

606
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:05,386
Swindling an innocent farmer
out of all he owned...

607
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:09,353
and lying to him, telling him
that the beans were magic.

608
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,228
Planted in the light
of a full moon!

609
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:16,831
What a shame to deceive a
simple little peasant.

610
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:19,335
Magic beans, indeed!

611
00:51:19,336 --> 00:51:21,971
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!

612
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:24,541
- What?
- There's something moving.

613
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:28,746
Why, yes. Well, maybe there
is some magic in them!

614
00:51:28,747 --> 00:51:32,008
All right, now let's all keep
quiet and see what happens.

615
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,305
Mmm.

616
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:48,787
And all through the night, it grew,

617
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:50,957
onward and upward.

618
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,956
That thing is a menace to aviation.

619
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:58,066
And so, with the coming of dawn,

620
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:01,503
we find the bewildered farmers
staring at a mammoth castle,

621
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,505
miles above the earth.

622
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:07,209
Their curiosity was aroused,
nothing could hold them back.

623
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,346
Who lives there? Man or monster?

624
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,350
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?

625
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,352
Well, search me.

626
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:18,489
What drew them toward
this place of mystery?

627
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,692
Hunger? Desperation?

628
00:54:20,693 --> 00:54:23,228
Or perhaps it was
love of adventure.

629
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:26,599
What a fantastic experience,
perhaps mortal man...

630
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,903
has never before set foot
on this strange land.

631
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:34,175
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?

632
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:37,278
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.

633
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:41,116
Soon they reached the moat
surrounding the castle.

634
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:46,122
But this didn't stop them. On they went,
as if drawn by some irresistible force.

635
00:54:46,123 --> 00:54:49,727
And then, suddenly, without
warning, out of the sky above...

636
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:51,863
Ooh, dragonflies!

637
00:54:51,864 --> 00:54:56,134
Yeah. A-flyin' front
and draggin' behind.

638
00:54:56,135 --> 00:55:00,705
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!

639
00:55:15,592 --> 00:55:19,559
Come back and fight!

640
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:53,235
Finally, they reached the castle.

641
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:56,571
The hard way.

642
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:02,612
This was the biggest
adventure of their lives.

643
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:06,485
Forgotten was their hunger,
forgotten was their fear.

644
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:09,588
It took courage to scale
these massive steps,

645
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:12,492
to make this journey
into the unknown.

646
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:15,662
But these stouthearted
lads never faltered.

647
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,132
Three minds with but
a single thought.:

648
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:21,869
What mystery lurked within
those cold, forbidding walls?

649
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:25,507
What strange spell hovered
over this gloomy place?

650
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:30,279
Will no one answer?

651
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,483
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?

652
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:36,787
You know, you could stand
some rehearsal on this story.

653
00:56:36,788 --> 00:56:40,491
Inside, the tremendous hall
was as silent as a tomb.

654
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:43,361
Not a sign of life anywhere.

655
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:45,364
Caught with his pants...

656
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:47,366
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...

657
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:50,169
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.

658
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,172
They gazed in speechless wonder,

659
00:56:52,173 --> 00:56:54,175
almost afraid to breathe.

660
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,711
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?

661
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:59,814
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!

662
00:58:18,209 --> 00:58:20,811
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?

663
00:58:20,812 --> 00:58:23,378
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!

664
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:27,685
How'd you get here?

665
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:30,355
I was kidnapped by
that wicked giant!

666
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:33,193
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!

667
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:35,395
- A giant?
- A giant!

668
00:58:35,396 --> 00:58:38,399
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!

669
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,670
An ogre who had the power to turn
himself into anything, man or beast.

670
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:44,806
That calls for a drink.

671
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:51,915
It was this heartless monster that
swooped down under cover of darkness,

672
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,947
carried off the golden harp and...

673
00:58:53,973 --> 00:58:56,286
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!

674
00:58:56,287 --> 00:58:58,657
Ohh!

675
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:00,727
Ohh!

676
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:05,898
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.

677
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:09,202
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.

678
00:59:09,203 --> 00:59:12,706
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.

679
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:15,876
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.

680
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:18,846
- No.
- No? Ten men?

681
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,883
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?

682
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:25,622
I don't know. I guess it's just
a stage I'm goin' through.

683
00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:27,624
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!

684
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,826
Now go over there and
behave yourself.

685
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,829
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.

686
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,799
But why did the giant
want to steal the harp?

687
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,437
Because he was cruel and selfish. He
didn't care what happened to the valley.

688
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:40,439
He just wanted someone
to sing him to sleep.

689
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,908
Well, why didn't he
turn on the radio?

690
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:44,944
Well, they didn't have
radios in those days.

691
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:48,449
Yeah. That's why they
called it Happy Valley.

692
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,586
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...

693
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,812
Oh... I'll try and show you.

694
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,863
He looked something like this.

695
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:14,780
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.

696
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:18,385
Never mind the
self-portraits. Ha-ha.

697
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:20,787
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like...

698
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:22,789
more like this.

699
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,794
There he is now. And the giant
came home for dinner, roaring...

700
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,673
- Drunk.
- I was not!

701
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:31,488
- I mean, he was not.
- No.

702
01:00:31,514 --> 01:00:34,817
Down the castle hall
he came, roaring...

703
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:38,575
Fe, fi, fo, fum!

704
01:00:38,576 --> 01:00:41,078
Fe, fi, fo, fum!

705
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:43,113
<i>Fe, fi, fo, fum</i>

706
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:45,150
<i>He, hi, ho, hum</i>

707
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:48,887
<i>I'm a most amazing guy
A most amazing guy am I</i>

708
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:51,157
<i>Fe, fi, fo, fum</i>

709
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:53,459
<i>He, hi, ho, hum</i>

710
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,196
<i>I'm the stuff, I'm tellin'
you for here's what I can do</i>

711
01:00:57,197 --> 01:00:59,533
<i>I can change myself into an elf</i>

712
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,601
<i>Fly up high like the birdies</i>

713
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:04,005
<i>I can disappear into atmosphere</i>

714
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:07,710
Peekaboo. <i>'Cause I
know the magic wordies</i>

715
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,915
<i>Fi, fo, fe, foy
Fe, fe, fe, fe</i>

716
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:16,886
Fifi? I don't know no Fifi.

717
01:01:16,887 --> 01:01:19,190
Those are his magic
words, you know.

718
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:22,159
Fe, fi, fo, fum.

719
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,363
- I smell...
- You're telling us!

720
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,065
Wait. He may be smarter
than he looks.

721
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:29,268
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.

722
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,939
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.

723
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,941
Well, don't tell him!

724
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:36,940
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!

725
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:42,050
Pot roast! Chocolate pot roast!

726
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:45,287
With stispacio...
With dismashmee...

727
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:47,289
With dismash...

728
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,357
With green gravy.

729
01:01:56,402 --> 01:02:00,205
Feedy, fidey,

730
01:02:00,206 --> 01:02:02,340
fodey,

731
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:05,872
fum!

732
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:16,557
Gesundheit.

733
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:23,032
Oh, no, you don't! You can't
get away from Willie.

734
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:25,168
I gotcha!

735
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:28,538
I think I gotcha.

736
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,377
Yeah, I gotcha.

737
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:34,379
Willie.

738
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,448
What?

739
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:38,384
He'll have to talk fast
to get out of this one.

740
01:02:38,385 --> 01:02:40,719
Well, you leave it
to Mickey. Just watch.

741
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,517
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!

742
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:48,729
But what's this here?

743
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,698
What is it? What is it!

744
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:53,735
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!

745
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:57,072
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here...

746
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,009
that you can change
yourself into anything!

747
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,111
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?

748
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:06,417
I can change myself into
the darndest things!

749
01:03:06,418 --> 01:03:09,955
Go on, gimme somethin'.

750
01:03:09,956 --> 01:03:12,792
- Anything!
- Anything?

751
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:15,728
Anything.

752
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,765
See? Mickey never misses a trick.

753
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:21,001
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...

754
01:03:21,002 --> 01:03:23,103
Can you change into a fly?

755
01:03:23,104 --> 01:03:27,775
A cute, teeny-weeny,
itsy-bitsy housefly?

756
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:30,445
That's it. A housefly.

757
01:03:30,446 --> 01:03:33,383
Aw, you don't want a fly.

758
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:37,855
How about a bunny
with long, pink ears?

759
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,825
Ha. Well, of course, if you
can't do a fly, why, uh...

760
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:43,895
All right. A fly.

761
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:47,599
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...

762
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,302
- Because.
- Okay.

763
01:03:50,303 --> 01:03:55,308
A teeny-weeny fly.

764
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:57,534
With pink wings.

765
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:00,582
Now for the magic wordies.

766
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,885
<i>Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum</i>

767
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:07,614
<i>I'm a most amazing guy
Te, ti, te, ti, te, ti</i>

768
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:12,829
You sure you don't
want a pink bunny?

769
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:15,465
Hey, what is this?

770
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,965
You think you fool Willie.

771
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:25,312
Yeah, a couple more good ideas
like that and they're finished.

772
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:27,981
Well, I'll admit the little
fellows are in a bad fix.

773
01:04:27,982 --> 01:04:30,317
But Mickey isn't one to
give up without a struggle.

774
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,321
And with a little luck,
they may still pull through.

775
01:04:33,322 --> 01:04:35,489
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.

776
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:39,194
Anybody wanna buy
a tall, thin mouse?

777
01:04:39,195 --> 01:04:41,659
No, thank you. Uh, I mean no.

778
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:45,702
Yes, things look pretty
dark for the prisoners.

779
01:04:45,703 --> 01:04:48,072
Looks like their goose is cooked.

780
01:04:48,073 --> 01:04:50,507
Oh, Fate may yet deal
them a winning hand.

781
01:04:50,508 --> 01:04:55,380
Don't forget, there's still the magic
harp. She knows the giant's weakness.

782
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:59,051
She could be my weakness.

783
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:01,053
There might still be a
chance of escape...

784
01:05:01,054 --> 01:05:04,391
if she could only use her magic
voice to put the giant to sleep.

785
01:05:04,392 --> 01:05:07,060
If she can't, I know who can.

786
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:10,660
Shh. Let's all be
quiet now, and see.

787
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:15,033
<i>In my favorite dream</i>

788
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:20,707
<i>Everyone is so delightful</i>

789
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:26,547
<i>No one's mean or spiteful</i>

790
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:30,751
<i>In my favorite dream</i>

791
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:36,091
<i>Yes, and in my favorite dream</i>

792
01:05:36,092 --> 01:05:41,932
<i>There my heart can go romancing</i>

793
01:05:41,933 --> 01:05:51,143
<i>Dancing to a heavenly theme</i>

794
01:05:51,144 --> 01:05:56,982
<i>But there's something else
I look forward to</i>

795
01:05:56,983 --> 01:05:59,753
<i>It's a secret</i>

796
01:05:59,754 --> 01:06:02,252
<i>But here's a clue</i>

797
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:07,796
<i>He's my favorite</i>

798
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:13,269
<i>You know who</i>

799
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,608
<i>You're the hero of</i>

800
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:21,946
<i>My most favorite</i>

801
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:25,684
<i>Dream</i>

802
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:27,820
Oh, mercy. Forgive us.

803
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,638
<i>In his right vest pocket</i>

804
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:46,475
<i>You'll find the key</i>

805
01:06:46,476 --> 01:06:50,942
<i>The right vest pocket
Go carefully</i>

806
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:58,252
Oh!

807
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:07,129
Ah... Ah... Ah...

808
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:12,339
I'll smash... Ah... I'll smash...

809
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:15,109
Ah... Ah... Ah...

810
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:17,608
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

811
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,219
Ah... Ah... Ah...

812
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:28,258
Where is he?

813
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:30,393
Hello?

814
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,400
Nightmare.

815
01:07:50,686 --> 01:07:53,822
Oh, boy.

816
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:02,665
- He made it!
- He did?

817
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:07,270
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!

818
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:12,878
Well, it looks like
success at last.

819
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:15,481
Free from the clutches of
that terrible monster.

820
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:20,020
And now to find the beanstalk, climb
down and return home in triumph,

821
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:22,489
with a big surprise
for Happy Valley.

822
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,493
But wait. Mickey's going
to make doubly sure.

823
01:08:25,494 --> 01:08:28,162
He's taking no chances.

824
01:08:28,163 --> 01:08:31,800
Just in case the
giant might wake up.

825
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:35,105
Oh!

826
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:37,706
Ha. Should have left
well enough alone.

827
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:46,882
Come back here! Come back here!

828
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:53,627
And there goes the giant!

829
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:58,971
He's helpless now, tumbling
over and over and over,

830
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:03,131
down, down, down, down.

831
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:08,849
And so with the passing
of the wicked giant,

832
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:13,088
Happy Valley echoed once again
with song and laughter.

833
01:10:13,089 --> 01:10:15,290
For with the return
of the magic harp,

834
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,094
peace and prosperity reigned
throughout the land.

835
01:10:18,095 --> 01:10:20,630
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.

836
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:23,099
Lived happily ever after.

837
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:27,171
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?

838
01:10:27,172 --> 01:10:29,406
Simply thrilling.

839
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:34,045
You're even better than the
old-fashioned sleeping pill.

840
01:10:34,046 --> 01:10:36,948
What's the matter, Mortimer?

841
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:41,922
Oh, the poor giant got
killed, that he did.

842
01:10:41,923 --> 01:10:45,793
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.

843
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:48,630
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.

844
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:52,535
He just got too big
for his britches.

845
01:10:52,536 --> 01:10:56,939
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.

846
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,543
I'll be all right.

847
01:10:59,544 --> 01:11:02,145
Oh, excuse me.

848
01:11:02,146 --> 01:11:05,056
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie the Giant...

849
01:11:05,082 --> 01:11:06,806
- didn't actually exist.
- No?

850
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:11,316
No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon
of your subconscious mind,

851
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:14,294
a phantasmagoria of
your mental faculties.

852
01:11:14,295 --> 01:11:15,182
Yeah?

853
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,732
In other words, just a
figment of your imagination.

854
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,734
- No!
- Yes.

855
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:25,373
So there's nothing
to be upset about.

856
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:30,580
Hey! Has anybody seen anything...

857
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:33,684
of a teensy-weensy little mouse?

858
01:11:33,685 --> 01:11:36,887
No. I-I-I, uh...

859
01:11:36,888 --> 01:11:39,390
Oh, Mr. Bergen!

860
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:43,094
Bergen, speak to me. Speak to me.

861
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:46,632
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?

862
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:50,269
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig...

863
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:53,107
fig-a-mentation of his imagination.

864
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,776
- No!
- Yeah.

865
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:59,114
Well, uh, good night, Willie.

866
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:02,117
Uh, don't slam the roof.

867
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:03,546
You might wake Mr. Bergen.

868
01:12:12,297 --> 01:12:15,566
<i>Now some folks don't
believe in giants</i>

869
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:17,803
<i>Castles up above</i>

870
01:12:17,804 --> 01:12:20,706
<i>And others say that
bears don't talk</i>

871
01:12:20,707 --> 01:12:23,576
<i>And never fall in love</i>

872
01:12:23,577 --> 01:12:26,413
<i>If you really wanna find</i>

873
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:28,415
<i>Happiness
Peace of mind</i>

874
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:30,417
<i>Believe in all your dreams</i>

875
01:12:30,418 --> 01:12:34,155
<i>And you will see</i>

876
01:12:34,156 --> 01:12:37,125
<i>You'll be full of fun and fancy</i>

877
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:39,274
<i>Free and full of fun</i>

878
01:12:39,275 --> 01:12:46,693
<i>And fancy-free</i>

878
01:12:47,305 --> 01:13:47,419
