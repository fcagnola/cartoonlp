might be sharks around here?

00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:20,291
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,335

95
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:01,559
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

Oh! Oh! Look at this.

Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

99
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:20,787
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

100
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,165
Humans use these little babies...

101
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,209
to straighten their hair out.

102
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:31,047

and a yank there and violee...

103

configuration of hair

104
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,220
that humans go nuts over.

105
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,305
A dinglehopper.

106
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,099
- What about that one?
- Ah!

107
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:46,980
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

108
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:52,318
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!

109
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:57,615
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

110
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,952
and stare at each other all day.

111
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,996
Got very boring.

112
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:07,584
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

113
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,961
Allow me.

114
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,504

115
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,882

- Oh, the concert!

117
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,802
The concert was today?

118
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:20,096
You could make
a little planter out of it.

119
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,516
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

120

121
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:27,353
Any time.

122
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:45,205
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

123
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:50,710
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

124
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:55,381
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

125
00:10:55,465 --> 00:11:00,470
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

126
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:04,766
when I lived in the palace.

127
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,561
And now look at me.

128
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:11,439
Wasted away to practically nothing.

129
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:15,568
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

130
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:20,698
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

131
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,787
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

132
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,039
Flotsam! Jetsam!

133
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:33,378
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

134
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,508
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

135
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:46,391
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

136
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,059
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

137
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:50,228
As a result of your careless behavior...

138
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,147
Careless and reckless behavior!

139
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,441
...the entire celebration was, uh...

140
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:58,194
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

141
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,405
This concert was to be

142
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:04,075
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

143
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,912
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

144
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,581
But it wasn't her fault...

145
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:13,334
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

146
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:16,921
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

147
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:20,175
And... And we... Whoa!

148
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,177
And then we were safe.

149
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,013
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

150
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:26,765
Seagull?

151
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,559
What? Oh!

152
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,728
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

153
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:34,272
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

154
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:38,568
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

155
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:43,281
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

156
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,909
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

157
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:49,954
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

158
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,540
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

159
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,293
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

160
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:58,838
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

161
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,800
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

162
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:06,262
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

163
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:08,306
Is that clear?

164
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,106
Hmph! Teenagers.

165
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,483
They think they know everything.

166
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:22,195
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

167
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,282
Do you think I was too hard on her?

168
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,493
Definitely not.

169
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:33,623
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

170
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:37,293
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

171
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:40,213
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

172
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:43,049
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

173
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,802
Ariel needs constant supervision.

174
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,638
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

175
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:49,806

Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

407
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:16,454
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

408
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,706
The sea king?

409
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,293
He wants to see you rightaway.
Something about Ariel.

410
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:25,004
He knows.

411
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,007
Hey, let's see now.

412
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:32,262
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

413
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:39,310
Come in, Sebastian.

414
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:42,564
I mustn't overreact.

415
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:46,025
I must remain calm.

416
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:53,742
Yes?

417
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,828
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

418
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,081
I'm concerned about Ariel.

419
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:03,501
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

420
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:08,548
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

421
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:12,343
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

422
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:14,512
You haven't noticed, hmm?

423
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:17,390
Oh, well, I...

424
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:20,894
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

425
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:25,857
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

426
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:29,152
Keeping something?

427
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:31,154
About Ariel?

428
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:37,744
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

429
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:43,333
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

430
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,544
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

431
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:51,341
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

432
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:54,969
Humans?

433
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:59,724
Who said anything about humans?

434
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:01,997
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

435
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,229
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

436
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:07,941
You'll see. It's a surprise.

437
00:34:08,024 --> 00:34:10,068
Oh, Flounder.

438
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:14,155
Flounder, you're the best!

439
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,785
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

440
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:23,915
Why, Eric, run away with you?

441
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:27,711
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

442
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,049
Daddy?

443
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,432
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

444
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:45,478
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

445
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:47,063
But, Dad, I...

446
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:50,400
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

447
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:51,443
I had to...

448
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:55,113
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

449
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:57,991
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

450
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:01,578
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

451
00:35:01,661 --> 00:35:03,913
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

452
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:07,083
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

453
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,586
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

454
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:11,087
incapable of any feeling...

455
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:14,090
Daddy, I love him!

456
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:18,428
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

457
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:20,430
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

458
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:21,973
I don't care.

459
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:26,186
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

460
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:30,148
And if this is the only way, so be it!

461
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:35,695
Daddy! No!

462
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,364
No! Please!

463
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:42,160
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

464
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:47,082
Daddy, no!

465
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,565
Ariel, I...

466
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,943
Just go away.

467
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:38,883
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

468
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:43,888
She has a very serious problem.

469
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,267
If only there were
something we could do.

470
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,270
But there is something.

471
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:55,024
Who... Who are you?

472
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,318
Don't be scared.

473
00:36:57,402 --> 00:37:00,613
We represent someone who can help you.

474
00:37:00,697 --> 00:37:05,785
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

475
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:07,912
Just imagine...

476
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:09,956
You and your prince...

477
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,585
Together forever.

478
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:15,587
I don't understand.

479
00:37:15,628 --> 00:37:21,468
Ursula has great powers.

480
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:25,513
The sea witch?

481
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:28,850
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

482
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:31,978
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

483
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:34,272
Suit yourself.

484
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:38,610
It was only a suggestion.

485
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,245
Wait.

486
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,749
Yes?

487
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:57,128
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

488
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:00,027
It was an accident.

489
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,801
Ariel? Where are you going?

490
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:05,470
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

491
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:07,472
I'm going to see Ursula.

492
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:11,976
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

493
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,355
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

494
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:20,235
But... But, I... Come on!

495
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,377
This way.

496
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,524
Come in. Come in, my child.

497
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:04,863
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

498
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:08,867
One might question
your upbringing.

499
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,455
Now, then, you're here

500
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:18,501
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

501
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:24,174
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

The only way to get what you want

505
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:35,894
is to become a human yourself.

506
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:39,064
Can you do that?

507
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:45,612
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

508
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:47,697

537
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:22,083
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

538
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,711
Got that? Three days.

539
00:41:24,794 --> 00:41:27,547
Now, listen, this is important.

540
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,008
Before the sun sets on the third day,

541
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,512
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

542
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:37,474
That is, he's got to kiss you.

543
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:43,021
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

544
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:46,816
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

545
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,862
you'll remain human permanently.

546
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:54,449

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,252
If I become human,

551
00:42:06,336 --> 00:42:09,089
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

552
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,466
That's right!

553
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:14,803

the subject of payment.

00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:48,053
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

630
00:47:48,094 --> 00:47:52,098

to do is dress like one. Let me see.

What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

639
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:37,602
Oh, I see.

640
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,772
Are you OK, miss?

641
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:43,149
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

642
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:45,443
He's harmless really, uh...

643
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:52,242
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

644
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,746
We have met. I knew it.

645

648
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,469
You can't speak? Oh!

649
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,139
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

650
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,021
What is it? You're hurt?

651
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:24,774
No, no. You need help?

652
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:27,485
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

653
00:49:28,737 --> 00:49:31,698
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

- No!
- Gertrude says...

662
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:10,737
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

663
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:14,074
- Really.
- Madam, please...

664
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:17,577
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

665
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,704

666
00:50:19,788 --> 00:50:23,249

672
00:50:47,232 --> 00:50:50,568
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

673
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,906
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

674
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:04,374
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

675

such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

680
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:40,368
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.

681
00:51:42,078 --> 00:51:43,997
Oh, my.

00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,915
Sorry, Grim.

683
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:50,628
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

684
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:53,298
Ah, very amusing.

I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

732
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,519

- Easy, Grim, easy.

733
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:55,814
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

734
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:57,273
Well, what do ya say?

735
00:54:57,357 --> 00:55:00,443
Would you like to join me on

Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

737
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,709
Come here, boy.

738
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:36,062
This has got to be, without a doubt,

739
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:40,650
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

740
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:46,197
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

741
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:50,326
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

742
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,498
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

743
00:55:55,582 --> 00:56:00,086
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

744
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:05,425
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

745
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:10,847
Hmm.

746
00:56:15,477 --> 00:56:20,732
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

747
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:24,444
Completely hopeless.

748
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,371
Any sign of them?

749
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:37,540
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

750
00:56:37,624 --> 00:56:40,919
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

751
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:45,256
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

752
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:49,469
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

753
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:51,554
Yes, sire.

754
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:58,103
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

755
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,181
Has he kissed her yet?

756
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:25,684
- Not yet.
- Oh!

757
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,692
Oh, Judy!

758
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:51,877
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

759
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,421
No, not yet.

760
00:57:54,462 --> 00:57:56,923
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

761
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,996
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

762
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,748
I can't see a thing.

763
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:33,001
Nothing is happening.

764
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:38,340
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

765
00:58:38,423 --> 00:58:44,930
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

766
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:48,016
Stand back!

767
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:53,355

01:07:01,593 --> 01:07:06,932
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

868
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:10,268
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

869
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:12,312
I mean, when it's important?

870
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,898
What are we gonna do?

871
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:18,693
Before the sun
sets on the third day.

872
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:21,154
Day...

873
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:27,994
Ariel, grab onto that.

874
01:07:28,036 --> 01:07:31,873
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

875
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:33,917
I'll try!

876
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,586
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

877
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,713
- What about me? What about me?
- You!

878
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:42,175
Find a way to stall that wedding!

879
01:07:42,217 --> 01:07:44,177
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?

880
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:46,972
What? That's it!

881
01:07:56,398 --> 01:07:57,941
Let's go!

882
01:07:58,024 --> 01:08:00,652
We got an emergency here.

883
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:14,624
Dearly beloved...

884
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:20,046
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

885
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:22,048
We're almost there.

886
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:26,011
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

887
01:08:26,052 --> 01:08:29,306
to be your lawfully wedded wife

888
01:08:29,389 --> 01:08:31,975
for as long as you both shall live?

889
01:08:32,058 --> 01:08:34,227
I do.

890
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:36,313
It being... And do you...

891
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:46,656
Oh!

892
01:08:48,742 --> 01:08:51,369
Oh! Oh! Oh!

893
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,374
Then by the power...

894
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,543
Get away, you slimy...

895
01:08:58,585 --> 01:09:00,212
Oh!

896
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,259
Oh!

897
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:11,598
Oh!

898
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,142
Oh, why, you little...

899
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:27,364
Huh?

900
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:37,040
Ariel?

901
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:40,335
Eric.

902
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:42,504
You... You can talk?

903
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:46,550
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

904
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:50,387
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

905
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:54,599
Eric, no!

906
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:57,602
You're too late!

907
01:09:57,644 --> 01:10:00,272
You're too late!

908
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:10,282
So long, lover boy.

909
01:10:10,365 --> 01:10:13,076
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

910
01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:16,079
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

911
01:10:16,163 --> 01:10:19,457
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

912
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:24,838
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

913
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,466
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

914
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:31,720
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

915
01:10:31,803 --> 01:10:35,223
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

916
01:10:38,685 --> 01:10:39,978
You see?

917
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,356
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

918
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,442
even for you.

919
01:10:45,525 --> 01:10:50,989
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

920
01:10:51,031 --> 01:10:56,411
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

921
01:10:56,494 --> 01:11:00,665
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

922
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:04,711
for someone even better.

923
01:11:04,753 --> 01:11:06,505
Eric, what are you doing?

924
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:10,300
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

925
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:14,971
Now, do we have a deal?

926
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:20,602
Ha! It's done then!

927
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:25,690
No! Oh, no!

928
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:36,368
Your Majesty.

929
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:37,702
Daddy.

930
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:42,249
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

931
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:48,713
You!

932
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:50,006
You monster!

933
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,259
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

934
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,262
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

935
01:11:55,303 --> 01:11:57,889
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

936
01:11:57,973 --> 01:11:59,933
After him!

937
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:09,442
Come on!

938
01:12:09,484 --> 01:12:12,237
Ow!

939
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:17,033
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

940
01:12:21,788 --> 01:12:26,501
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

941
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:39,264
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

942
01:12:39,347 --> 01:12:41,600
No, I won't leave you.

943
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:04,039
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

944
01:13:04,122 --> 01:13:06,082
Look out!

945
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:10,795
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

946
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:14,466
The waves obey my every whim!

947
01:13:14,549 --> 01:13:18,637
Eric!

948
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:24,434
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

949
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:45,747
Eric!

950
01:14:08,353 --> 01:14:10,272
Oh! Oh!

951
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:22,826
So much for true love!

952
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,346
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

953
01:15:24,429 --> 01:15:30,310
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

954
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:35,357
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

955
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,359
You always say that?

956
01:15:40,278 --> 01:15:44,574
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

957
01:15:44,658 --> 01:15:46,785
And what's that, Your Majesty?

958
01:15:46,827 --> 01:15:50,455
How much I'm going to miss her.

959
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:51,725
Ah-ha!

960
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:03,486
Yes!

961
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:05,447
Thank you. Thank you.

962
01:17:15,415 --> 01:17:17,042
I love you, Daddy.
