00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,021
That one. 

3
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:06,127
Here, boy.

4
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,724
You're heavy.

5
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,128
And slobbery.

6
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,884
There.

7
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,590
You're a good boy.

8
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,258
You're my good boy.

9
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,314
Hello?

10
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,857
Penny,
I don't have much time.

11
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,723
<i>Daddy?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

12
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,521
Something's come up at work, honey.

13
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:54,007
Daddy's not gonna
be home for a while.

14
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,361
I don't understand.

15
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:59,427
<i>You can't go back</i>
<i>to the house, Penny. Okay?</i>

16
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:01,786
<i>What's happening?</i>

17
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:07,070
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>You won't be alone. You have Bolt.</i>

18
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:10,644
<i>I've altered him.</i>

19
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,168
<i>He can protect you now.</i>

20
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:56,926
<i>The doctor has been taken care of,</i>
<i>which, of course, is wonderful news.</i>

21
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,932
<i>Everything is positioning nicely.</i>

22
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:03,631
There he is. Dr. Calico.

23
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,099
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

24
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:15,012
<i>Oh! His guts will spill,</i>
<i>one way or another.</i>

25
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:17,050
<i>Never! I'll never talk.</i>

26
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,247
Daddy!

27
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:25,849
<i>You're beginning to irk me, professor.</i>
<i>I am irked, and that will not do.</i>

28
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,428
<i>Has the package arrived?</i>

29
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:33,831
<i>I think it might make our dear friend</i>
<i>a bit more communicative.</i>

30
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,233
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

31
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:41,206
<i>Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me</i>
<i>on the first flight.</i>

32
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,513
Bolt, let's go.

33
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:26,150
<i>We only need the girl.</i>

34
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:01,346
What?

35
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,686
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

36
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,987
Bolivia! Bolivia!
Calico's in Bolivia!

37
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,997
Near Lake Rogaguado!

38
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,668
Lake Rogaguado! I should've known.

39
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,038
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

40
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,435
Bolivia.
There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

41
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,317
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

42
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,598
Bolt, fetch.

43
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,886
Puppy!

44
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,210
Good boy.

45
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:45,606
Airport.

46
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,475
Uh-oh!

47
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,586
Bolt, speak.

48
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,321
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

49
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,998
Mission accomplished.

50
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,271
That's a keeper.

51
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:51,543
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

52
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,802
Don't worry, Bolt.
You saved the day again.

53
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:04,190
All right. Good job.
Let's strike the set.

54
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:09,955
We're gonna need a cable guard on set
for that move tomorrow.

55
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:11,655
Yeah. All right.

56
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,135
<i>Good boy.</i>

57
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,531
<i>Airport.</i>

58
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,535
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

59
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,376
<i>Bolt, speak.</i>

60
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,185
- Boom mike.
- We got a boom mike.

61
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,879
It's a boom mike.

62
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,420
That's sloppy.

63
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:42,291
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

64
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,760
Uh... Who cares
if the dog sees a boom mike?

65
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,098
What? Who's that?

66
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:52,017
Forgive me for answering a question
with a question,

67
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:55,058
but who are you?

68
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,928
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

69
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:03,197
Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network,

70
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:05,132
what do you see here?

71
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:06,729
Uh...

72
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,939
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

73
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:15,212
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

74
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,877
Am I missing something?

75
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,746
You're missing everything, Mindy.

76
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,786
You see a dog.

77
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:29,087
I see an animal who believes with
every fiber of his being, every fiber,

78
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,890
that the girl he loves is
in mortal danger.

79
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:34,021
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

80
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:38,398
the likes of which has never
been captured on screen before!

81
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,987
Never, Mindy from the network!

82
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,176
Hmm.

83
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:47,316
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

84
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,760
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

85
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:55,824
and it's why we most certainly
do not let the dog see boom mikes!

86
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:01,370
Because, Mindy from the network,

87
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:09,443
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

88
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:13,545
Wow. Okay.

89
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:17,646
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

90
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:21,215
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

91
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,589
There's always a happy ending.

92
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:26,096
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-35-year-olds are unhappy.

93
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,860
They're not happy with happy.

94
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,832
So maybe you should, I don't know,

95
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,666
spend a little less time
worrying about the dog's Method acting

96
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:33,864
and more time figuring out

97
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,464
how to stop 20-year-olds in Topeka
from changing the channel.

98
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,374
Because if you lose
so much as half a rating point,

99
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:43,677
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

100
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,380
How's that for real?

101
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,613
There. Perfect.

102
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,326
You saved me again, Bolt.

103
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:01,590
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

104
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:05,198
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

105
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:13,575
You got them, Bolt.
No one's gonna hurt me.

106
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:17,948
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

107
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:22,246
Come here, buddy. Come here.

108
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,882
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

109
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:29,958
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

110
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:33,456
Well, what do we have here?

111
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:37,559
Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot.

112
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,887
Bolt. You know I have to go.

113
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:18,244
Yeah, you're my good boy.

114
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:29,420
There she is. My little superstar.

115
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,683
Let's get to that <i>Teen Vogue</i>
cover shoot.

116
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,851
Mom, I wanna take Bolt home
this weekend.

117
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,292
Well, I...

118
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,320
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

119
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:43,266
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

120
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:48,766
So I can bring Bolt home?

121
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:52,602
As your friend I say, "Yes, absolutely,"

122
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,448
but as your agent, I have to remind you
this is Bolt's world.

123
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,111
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

124
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,347
But he never gets to be a real dog,

125
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,447
and it would only be for the weekend,
and I just want...

126
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:08,118
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

127
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:11,424
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.
Boop! Pin in.

128
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:13,692
There you go.
Now, let's let that hang there a bit,

129
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,791
and then we'll address that
when we've thought things through.

130
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,426
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

131
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,596
Smiles all around?
Let's get out of here. Come on.

132
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:23,233
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

133
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:25,937
Look at this face.

134
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,445
I have a little girl at home,
love of my life.

135
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,846
I would do anything for her,

136
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,919
and I would trade her for you
in a heartbeat.

137
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,016
True story.

138
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,750
That reminds me,
we need to be getting over to wardrobe.

139
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:39,984
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

140
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:42,118
I need her in hair.
- I just...

141
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:43,855
Can I get her for five minutes
in makeup?

142
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,727
I wanna go for something more natural.

143
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:55,074
So the dog thinks
this is all real?

144
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,937
Oh, yeah, you're new.

145
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:59,637
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

146
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:03,546
Whenever I get the chance,
this is the perfect way to unwind.

147
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:07,986
I like to start with an evil laugh.

148
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,852
Hello, hairballs.

149
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,895
You may have won today, Bolt,

150
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:21,228
but in the end,
we will get your little Penny.

151
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:24,929
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

152
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,475
Ultimately, it will destroy you,
along with your fiendish puppet master!

153
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,877
- Wow!
- I know, right? Okay, watch this.

154
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,613
She's a goner, dog.

155
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:40,880
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

156
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:48,888
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

157
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:52,431
I would superbark you both
back into the hole you crawled out of,

158
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:55,000
but I need you alive
because I've got a little message

159
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:57,433
for you to take back
to your Green-Eyed Man.

160
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:59,903
You tell him
his old friend Bolt said he better...

161
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,337
Is it long?

162
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,175
- Is what long?
- The message.

163
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:07,838
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

164
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:10,177
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

165
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:12,342
You know what? Why don't we do this?

166
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,682
You remember
the first half of the message,

167
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,482
and then I'll remember the second,

168
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,648
and then we can pass it on
to the Green-Eyed Man together.

169
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:21,556
Now, I don't care how
the message is translated, all right?

170
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,094
Just do it, okay.

171
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,494
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

172
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:29,398
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

173
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:30,696
You tell the Green-Eyed Man
that reckoning...

174
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:32,100
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

175
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:33,729
Way too many words.

176
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,139
I was, like, "What?"
And then I was, like, "Huh?"

177
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:41,475
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

178
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,674
Anyway, I'll do my best. <i>Ciao.</i>

179
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:47,184
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

180
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:52,325
Get back here,
you sick, revolting, loathsome little...

181
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:58,421
Dogs.

182
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,891
Cats.

183
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,109
I'll never let them get you, Penny.

184
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:30,829
Are you ready, Bolt?

185
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:39,864
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

186
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,375
And driver.

187
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,273
Thanks, Larry.

188
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:53,919
<i>All right, Scooter.</i>

189
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,648
<i>Find the grate.</i>
<i>Ready on the rubber bars.</i>

190
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,987
<i>And track with them.</i>

191
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,966
The Calico supercomputer.

192
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:13,071
If we can access it, we'll finally learn
where they're keeping my father.

193
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:33,551
The weapon's hot.

194
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,721
Heat vision time.

195
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,689
Bolt, stare.

196
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,925
Now!

197
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:55,644
Nice move.

198
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,244
Come on. Come on.

199
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:06,748
Such devotion.
It brings tears to my eyes.

200
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,190
Calico.

201
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:14,494
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organization.

202
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:21,731
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

203
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,300
Bolt!

204
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:29,579
World domination is within my grasp!

205
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:44,687
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

206
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:47,732
You ask for
unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds,

207
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:52,861
I give you unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds.

208
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:55,803
<i>Bolt! It's okay, Bolt.
I'm fine.</i>

209
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:56,932
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

210
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,340
<i>Guards, stop her!</i>

211
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:00,810
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

212
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:03,575
Listen to him.
He needs to know I'm okay.

213
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:05,708
Nope, you're not okay.

214
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:08,810
You've been kidnapped
by the fiendish Dr. Calico,

215
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:10,855
at least
that's what the dog needs to think,

216
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:13,448
but just imagine,
close your eyes and imagine

217
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,552
how excited he'll be
when he saves you tomorrow. Okay?

218
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,790
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

219
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:21,730
- Please, just let me...
- What...

220
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,029
Wait a second,
what's that behind your ear?

221
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,501
Is that a...

222
00:22:25,838 --> 00:22:28,932
Yes, it is.
It's a pin. Let's do this.

223
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:32,704
Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation. Boop!

224
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:34,507
And we will not take it down,
no, ma'am,

225
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,274
until this matter is resolved.

226
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,509
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

227
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,950
The DVD release junket.
Let's get going. It's a big push.

228
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:44,784
I want to go with a modern look,
something that says,

229
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,949
"I'm 13, and I'm fine with that."

230
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,291
All right, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

231
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,398
I've been working on my evil laugh.

232
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,497
'Cause everybody has an evil laugh.

233
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,433
Like that.

234
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:08,775
Okay, here's the thing.
You're not ready for the evil laugh.

235
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:11,509
You could do a chuckle,
like a mildly upset chuckle,

236
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,175
after my evil laugh.

237
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:14,252
Listen to mine.

238
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:16,388
Hey, Bolt.

239
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,550
Big fan!

240
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:21,383
Bolt! Come back!

241
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,559
I'm too late.

242
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:29,566
<i>Bolt! Help!</i>
- I'm coming, Penny!

243
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,134
<i>Bolt! Help!</i>

244
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,774
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

245
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:41,941
<i>Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!</i>

246
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,219
Penny!

247
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,803
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

248
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:35,992
Huh?

249
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:41,962
Whoa!

250
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,406
Okay! Hey! Hey!

251
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:55,685
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

252
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,853
Oh!

253
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,324
The Green-Eyed Man.

254
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:21,604
Hmm.

255
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:24,640
Huh?

256
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,956
Penny! Penny!

257
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:49,068
Ow!

258
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:58,409
Penny!

259
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,018
Target acquired.

260
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:17,201
It ends here.

261
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,142
Penny!

262
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,116
Penny? They moved her.

263
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:39,284
There's no time
for formalities, brothers.

264
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,756
My person's in danger, and I...

265
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,486
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

266
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:45,989
You wanna sniff mine first?

267
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:47,065
What?

268
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,155
Not from around here,
are you?

269
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,735
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

270
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,938
Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie?

271
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:56,671
Hey! Wait!

272
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:22,161
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

273
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:25,360
Oh, buddy.

274
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,833
You got your head stuck pretty good,
huh, guy?

275
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,808
Hey, guys, come here.

276
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:35,709
Check this out.
He's got his melon stuck.

277
00:27:36,582 --> 00:27:39,574
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

278
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:45,054
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

279
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:48,684
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

280
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:56,326
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this.
Turn and pull. Turn and pull.

281
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,465
Forget about it. You'll be out, no time.

282
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:15,151
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

283
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:23,386
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

284
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,123
This has the Green-Eyed Man
written all over it.

285
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:28,165
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

286
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:31,202
You know,
I gotta say something,

287
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:32,998
if I could say something here.

288
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:36,506
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

289
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:40,271
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

290
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:41,368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,041
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

292
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,117
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

293
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:48,686
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

294
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:49,776
Listen, listen!

295
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:53,449
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

296
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,858
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

297
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:01,133
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

298
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,300
No, I don't know. I thought I knew.

299
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:13,105
Hey, you ever hang out down on
14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?

300
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:16,709
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

302
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:20,251
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridonculous.

303
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:21,944
Absolutely ridonculous.

304
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,885
<i>Capisce,</i> ridonculous.
You know what that means?

305
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,852
You pigeons are useless.

306
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:31,055
I need someone on the inside,
someone close to the Green-Eyed Man.

307
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:32,923
A cat.

308
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,396
Ooh. A cat?

309
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,196
Yeah, a cat.

310
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:39,736
And when I find him,
when I find him,

311
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:42,898
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

312
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:48,472
I think we know just the cat.

313
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,184
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

314
00:29:58,323 --> 00:29:59,984
Okay, Saul, nice work.

315
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,060
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

316
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:04,823
Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

317
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:10,724
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

318
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:12,463
Good day, Mittens.

319
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:15,140
Louie?

320
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:17,631
What is this?

321
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:22,278
It was a slow week.
That's half of what I got.

322
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,314
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

323
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:29,951
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

324
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:34,651
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

325
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,625
Not the claws! Please.

326
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:39,060
I'm holding these bad boys back,
best I can,

327
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:42,224
but, thing is, it's not up to me.

328
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:44,802
The stomach's got a direct line
to these babies

329
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:48,270
and I'm picking up a lot of chatter.

330
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,874
So, I'll talk to the claws,

331
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:55,106
but in exchange,
next week all your food comes to me.

332
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:57,512
But that's not our deal.

333
00:30:57,616 --> 00:31:01,245
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

334
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:04,948
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

335
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,585
Mark my words, Mittens.

336
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:11,094
One day
someone's gonna stand up to you.

337
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,756
Someone's gonna teach you a lesson.

338
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,390
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

339
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,101
You should be!

340
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,602
Okay! Yeah!

341
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:20,763
Where is she?

342
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:21,931
Uh...

343
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,267
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

344
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:27,436
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

345
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:29,810
Look, buddy, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

346
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:35,084
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.

347
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,745
Tell the dog, make him happy.

348
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:39,449
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

349
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,821
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

350
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:48,961
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

351
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:51,963
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

352
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,369
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

353
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:59,666
Looks like we're gonna do this
the hard way.

354
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,843
Whoa!

355
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:03,881
Hey, you're crazy, man!

356
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:08,381
Hey, Joey. Did we go too far in this?

357
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:12,389
You kidding?
This is the best day of my life.

358
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:14,022
You work for the men in black,

359
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:15,753
who work for the man
with the green eye.

360
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,388
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

361
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:24,026
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

362
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:27,071
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk!

363
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:30,733
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

364
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:34,778
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

365
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,177
Blue eyes?

366
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:37,441
Um... Oh!

367
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:40,109
Green! Yes, green! The one green eye!

368
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:45,121
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

369
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:49,488
I know. It's disgusting.
I disgust myself.

370
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,260
Hollywood.

371
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,962
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

372
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:59,103
Hmm.

373
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:11,546
You know, I hope you
appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

374
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:15,242
Every bone
in my evil cat body is telling me

375
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:18,323
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

376
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:25,729
Okay. This is a top, top secret map
of the entire Earth.

377
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:31,502
Now we're over here,
by the green lady with the big torch,

378
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:34,003
and my boss has Penny locked up...

379
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:35,164
Uh...

380
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:40,905
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

381
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:44,073
Now all you need to do
is get from here to there.

382
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:45,171
Hmm.

383
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:50,812
Well, I told you where to find her so
if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

384
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:53,584
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

385
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:57,685
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal.
We had a deal!

386
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,661
Your deal just expired.

387
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:03,196
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago.

388
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,064
The irony.

389
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,297
Ooh!

390
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,604
Perfect.

391
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:18,505
Hmm.

392
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:19,914
Padlocked.

393
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,048
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked
claws under these mitts.

394
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,289
Do not, I beg of you, do not make me
bring out these bad boys.

395
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,130
It gets ugly.

396
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,565
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

397
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,867
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

398
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:44,442
Now I'm concerned
on a number of levels.

399
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:45,532
Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

400
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:46,702
Watch it, though. Ow!
- You got it?

401
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:49,042
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

402
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:51,843
You're scraping the fur off my...

403
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:56,651
Oh, boy. This thing is heavy.

404
00:34:56,755 --> 00:35:00,054
Hey, hey. Put it down.
I forgot the keys.

405
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,757
I'll be right back.

406
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:10,825
Oh!

407
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,071
Hey, lucky penny!

408
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,035
Thanks! Now move your butt.

409
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,201
Okay. Up on your end.
- All right, just a little bit.

410
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,278
Like that? A little bit more.

411
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:21,640
Yeah. I got... No, I got mine.

412
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,078
You got it?

413
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:35,584
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey.

414
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:38,424
Bobby, you guys are looking at me like,
"He don't know."

415
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,693
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

416
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,564
Hey, you'll remember it tonight
when you're preening.

417
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,864
Right, that's what'll happen.

418
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:14,058
I have got some good news.

419
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,793
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

420
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:20,065
I just booked you
on <i>The Tonight Show,</i> lead guest.

421
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,139
That's right.

422
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:27,334
Which means just absolutely nothing
if Bolt is still missing.

423
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,845
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

424
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,712
<i>The Tonight Show,</i> who cares?
I don't care.

425
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:33,876
Aw.

426
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,577
It's okay, baby.

427
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:39,456
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

428
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:43,722
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

429
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:48,224
I bet Bolt would want you
to do <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

430
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:53,461
Or maybe not.

431
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:59,741
Bolt loves you very much, sweetie,
and you're here.

432
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:03,305
He couldn't have gone far.

433
00:37:10,055 --> 00:37:13,388
So, if you got superpowers,

434
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:17,188
I guess that would make you,
what, like, some kind of superdog?

435
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:18,660
That information's classified.

436
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:21,493
Come on.
Like, what's your best power?

437
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,330
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

438
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:29,269
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

439
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,774
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

440
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,504
What's it to me?

441
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:36,277
I have a superbark.

442
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:39,043
A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me.

443
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:45,486
What exactly
does one do with a superbark?

444
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,991
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

445
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,859
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

446
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:56,093
You're awfully attached
to this Penny character, huh, Wags?

447
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:59,659
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

448
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:04,105
And if you ask me,
the only good person is a...

449
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,443
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

450
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:14,875
Tuck and what?

451
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:29,891
Ow!

452
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,025
What?

453
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:35,732
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

454
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,774
It's called blood, hero.

455
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:41,245
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

456
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:44,611
So if you wanna keep it
inside your body, where it belongs,

457
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:48,413
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

458
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,387
Yeah, well, normally,
I'm a tad more indestructible.

459
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:52,513
Must've been the...

460
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:56,390
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

461
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:57,884
Ah-ha!

462
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,156
What are you doing? Put that down!

463
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:02,097
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

464
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,068
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

465
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:08,765
I'm gonna seriously wound you
with this Styrofoam.

466
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,842
Are you mad?
You don't know the power of Styrofoam.

467
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:13,604
Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

468
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:17,239
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

469
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,338
Whoa!

470
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,851
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

471
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,850
That's a weird place to put a piano.

472
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,755
Are we gonna have
any more problems, cat?

473
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,391
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

474
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:42,907
- What is that?
- What?

475
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,703
That! Okay.

476
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:47,607
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

477
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,010
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

478
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:52,242
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

479
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,339
I can't think straight.

480
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:56,045
I don't believe this. You're hungry.

481
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:00,452
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

482
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,521
There's your antidote.

483
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:08,554
Food.

484
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,361
All right, who wants burgers?

485
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,197
I'll take one.
- Me, too!

486
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:13,793
What's this?

487
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:17,170
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

488
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:19,810
You know, beg.

489
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:23,314
Do the dog face.

490
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,407
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

491
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,883
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth
who doesn't know how to beg.

492
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:34,957
Okay, if you want the... The antidote,

493
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,858
you're gonna have to do
exactly what I say.

494
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,588
No. Not likely.

495
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:43,292
You're a degenerate creature
of darkness.

496
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,631
Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said,

497
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:48,069
all I'm asking you to do
is just tilt your head a little.

498
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:50,664
You can do that, can't you? Come on.

499
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,040
More. More.

500
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:55,635
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

501
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,806
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

502
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,178
Oh, boy.

503
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,816
Okay. Try it the other way.

504
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,321
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

505
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:11,157
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

506
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,560
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

507
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:18,534
Hold it. Right there.
And ever so slightly, look up.

508
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,529
Soup is on, baby!

509
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,084
Aw!

510
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,173
Oh!

511
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,684
Here you go!

512
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:37,812
Yes!

513
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:42,748
Aw!

514
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,795
Look at the little guy.

515
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:47,361
Aw!

516
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,196
Beat it, stupid cat!

517
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,275
<i>Why do you care?</i>

518
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,744
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>what really happened...</i>

519
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:04,178
<i>And why does that</i>
<i>matter to you?</i>

520
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:05,681
<i>Because I'm involved!</i>

521
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:07,478
<i>With Ridge?</i>
<i>- With James!</i>

522
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:09,553
<i>If you and James were</i>
<i>romantic, I wanna know about it.</i>

523
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,179
<i>What, so you can...</i>

524
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:12,847
<i>Come on down!</i>

525
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:14,658
<i>Gilligan,</i>
<i>why don't you stop that.</i>

526
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,523
<i>Come on, no Whammies!</i>
<i>No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!</i>

527
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:19,790
<i>For weather</i>
<i>on the ones, here's Lester.</i>

528
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:21,092
<i>It really does help,</i>

529
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,690
<i>and it really releases</i>
<i>the serotonin, and...</i>

530
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,702
<i>Hey, man,</i>
<i>this time we'll do it my way.</i>

531
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:27,828
Ooh!

532
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:35,476
Well, hello, puppy.

533
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,811
Did you come for some of Grandma's
butter bean dumplings?

534
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,043
Mmm-mmm.

535
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:41,311
You wait right there.

536
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:43,979
<i>One of these days,</i>
<i>I'm gonna pound y'all to the ground.</i>

537
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:46,079
<i>No more Mr. Nice Guy.</i>

538
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:53,020
Look at you.
You are quite the little actor, huh?

539
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:55,497
I haven't eaten
like this in ages.

540
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,660
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

541
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,739
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

542
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,706
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

543
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:09,371
Every week new RVs bring us
new suckers who bring us new food.

544
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,778
Look around! It's perfect.

545
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:19,213
Do my eyes deceive me?

546
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:22,259
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

547
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:26,552
Or could it be my hero?

548
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,564
Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

549
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:35,534
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

550
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:42,440
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

551
00:43:42,547 --> 00:43:45,141
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've established that. Who are you?

552
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,481
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

553
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:51,111
Well, you know,
my ancestry isn't all hamster.

554
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:55,056
I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know,
a little wolverine in there somewhere,

555
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,888
but that's besides the point.

556
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:01,830
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

557
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,164
He can outrun speeding missiles

558
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,568
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

559
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:13,007
Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

560
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:16,046
Wait a minute.
You've seen the superbark?

561
00:44:16,147 --> 00:44:18,172
Have you been observing me?

562
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:22,583
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

563
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:24,154
Oh, it's nothing, really.

564
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:26,086
But I'm always so vigilant.

565
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,058
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

566
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:31,626
Uh...

567
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:34,391
If you say so. Hey, check it out.

568
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,896
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh? It's like we're twins.

569
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:44,907
Yeah. Scary.

570
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,601
So, where's Penny?

571
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:49,873
She was kidnapped
by the Green-Eyed Man.

572
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:54,384
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

573
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:57,716
Grave danger. I know.
But I've captured this cat.

574
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:01,383
An agent of the Green-Eyed Man,
I presume?

575
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:04,554
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

576
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:10,225
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

577
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:15,068
Penny's the most wonderful person
ever, and she loves Bolt.

578
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:18,904
And he's awesome,
and you're a monster!

579
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,208
How dare you disrupt their relationship
with your evil!

580
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,612
- Die! Die!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

581
00:45:25,717 --> 00:45:28,208
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

582
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,720
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

583
00:45:32,156 --> 00:45:34,920
You're right. We need her alive.

584
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:36,282
Uh...

585
00:45:36,394 --> 00:45:38,021
- "We"?
- Yes!

586
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:41,621
Bolt, I can be a valuable addition
to your team.

587
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:43,724
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

588
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:48,431
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

589
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,268
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

590
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:54,976
The road'll be rough.

591
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,171
I have a ball.

592
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,611
There's no turning back.

593
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:59,706
Guess I'll have to roll with the punches.

594
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,614
Easy won't be part of the equation.

595
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:02,743
Promise?

596
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,379
I gotta warn you.
Going into the belly of the beast,

597
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,787
danger at every turn.

598
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:09,121
I eat danger for breakfast.

599
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,489
You hungry?

600
00:46:11,696 --> 00:46:12,958
Starving!

601
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:14,031
Welcome aboard!

602
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,233
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

603
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:21,161
I don't know what's going on here,

604
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:25,902
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

605
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,671
My limit is one.

606
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:28,837
He's coming with us.

607
00:46:28,946 --> 00:46:30,140
But I... Huh?

608
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:31,476
Hey!

609
00:46:31,582 --> 00:46:33,777
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

610
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:37,787
I agree. Now,
we need to find a fast set of wheels.

611
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:41,618
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

612
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:57,496
Okay. So what we do here is
we give the target a quick flyover,

613
00:46:57,608 --> 00:47:00,372
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead center.

614
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:02,139
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

615
00:47:02,246 --> 00:47:04,578
Just the knowledge that every minute
spent in your company

616
00:47:04,682 --> 00:47:07,014
becomes the new greatest minute
of my life.

617
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:09,814
No! Forget it!
How do you say

618
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:12,185
"No way I'm doing this" in crazy?

619
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,951
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

620
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:15,286
That's the problem!

621
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:18,559
Would you relax?

622
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:22,497
Every time he did this on the magic box
it was awesome.

623
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,859
Magic what?

624
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:29,701
You know,
the magic box people stare at.

625
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:32,742
Wait a minute. Does this magic box
have moving pictures on it?

626
00:47:32,844 --> 00:47:35,335
Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best.

627
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:39,507
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

628
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,778
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

629
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:44,650
Let it begin. Let it begin. Let it begin!

630
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:46,416
Wait! You are not a superhero...

631
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:53,260
Whoa!

632
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:57,296
What are you doing?

633
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:14,716
Mittens!

634
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,151
Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive!

635
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:19,951
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

636
00:48:20,057 --> 00:48:22,184
Take my paw. I'll save you.

637
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:24,921
No, you won't! You're not really a...

638
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:43,236
Bolt!

639
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,179
Saboteur.

640
00:48:48,586 --> 00:48:49,883
Ow!

641
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:52,285
Ouch! You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

642
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,756
Help him? Yeah, right.

643
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,821
Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her!

644
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,701
I can't hold it.

645
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:16,773
Let go, you monster!

646
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:18,041
Bolt!

647
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:39,393
Ow!

648
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,404
Ow! Ow! Ow!

649
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,747
The real world hurts,
doesn't it?

650
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:53,442
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

651
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:56,213
Get down here, cat.
We don't have time for this.

652
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,947
I'll get a ladder.

653
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,825
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

654
00:50:03,928 --> 00:50:09,867
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

655
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:11,298
That's preposterous.

656
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:12,426
Think about it, Bolt.

657
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:15,130
Since you got lost, none of your powers
are working, are they?

658
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,140
For the first time, you're hungry,
you're bleeding.

659
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:21,211
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

660
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:25,043
in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?

661
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:27,447
It's my mark of power, cat.

662
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:29,678
It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog.

663
00:50:29,787 --> 00:50:32,347
You're ridiculous. Now get down here.

664
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:35,249
No.

665
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,159
Mittens, so help me,
I will superbark you out of that tree.

666
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:42,494
Yeah. Go nuts.
Let's see how that works out for you.

667
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,625
You leave me no choice.

668
00:50:53,444 --> 00:50:58,814
Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

669
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:03,685
It's not true. It's just not true.

670
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:10,593
Wow. That one felt really super.

671
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:12,824
Wait. No, it didn't.

672
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:18,659
Okay, okay. Mmm-hmm. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

673
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:24,969
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop.
I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's...

674
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:31,005
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

675
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:34,949
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

676
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:36,942
Bolt!

677
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:38,351
Come here!

678
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:14,559
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

679
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:15,657
Bolt!

680
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:18,636
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

681
00:52:23,926 --> 00:52:25,518
That is not Bolt.

682
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:29,959
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

683
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:34,528
You know, when I was little,
I wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

684
00:52:34,637 --> 00:52:37,299
but my parents got me
a baseball glove.

685
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,465
So, you know what I did?

686
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:44,069
I pretended that baseball glove
was a bicycle,

687
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:47,147
and I rode it to school every day.

688
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:48,847
True story.

689
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:51,247
It's not him.

690
00:52:51,353 --> 00:52:53,218
I think it's him. I do.

691
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:58,988
Thank you. Look, kid.
It's time we were honest with you.

692
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:02,154
If we don't get back into production,
people are going to lose their jobs.

693
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:03,925
Good people, with families.

694
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,466
But Bolt's still out there, and...

695
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:07,194
Now, we feel for you,

696
00:53:07,303 --> 00:53:09,464
and the last thing we wanna do
is ask a little girl

697
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:12,904
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

698
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:14,942
We need you to move on.

699
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,538
We need you to let Bolt go.

700
00:53:36,065 --> 00:53:37,123
Huh?

701
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:48,340
Must be made of Styrofoam.

702
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:52,572
No, no! No, no, no, please, please,
it can't end like this!

703
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,707
Stop worrying, cat!
I'll get us out of here.

704
00:53:55,818 --> 00:54:00,084
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

705
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:03,552
And no heat vision.

706
00:54:04,026 --> 00:54:05,186
Listen to me, okay?

707
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:09,230
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

708
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,528
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

709
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:17,230
The ones that look like you, Bolt.
But the rest of us never come back out.

710
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,137
I said I'll get us
out of here, all right?

711
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:25,337
Ohhh!

712
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:31,112
My hero.

713
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:50,168
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

714
00:54:51,507 --> 00:54:54,032
I've been expecting your call.

715
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,033
Ow!

716
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:31,772
Would you
give it up already?

717
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,974
You're liquefying
whatever brains you have left.

718
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:41,580
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

719
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:52,224
I did it! I'm back!

720
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,566
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

721
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:57,696
Fully awesome!

722
00:55:57,806 --> 00:56:01,742
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

723
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:04,904
Rhino? What are you doing here?

724
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,612
Oh, nothing.
I was enjoying an evening stroll

725
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:11,652
and thought I'd just pop the hatch
on that containment unit.

726
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:15,256
You opened the door?

727
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:17,086
Yes, I did!

728
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:23,455
That's great, Rhino.
Yeah, that's really good.

729
00:56:23,565 --> 00:56:26,728
All right.
Let's go get the prisoner back.

730
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:44,418
I can't do it.

731
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:49,081
What did you say?

732
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:50,885
I can't.

733
00:56:51,827 --> 00:56:53,124
Who are you?

734
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:55,321
Rhino, you just don't under...

735
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,921
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

736
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:01,059
Who singlehandedly destroyed
the Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?

737
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,159
Me, but...

738
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:07,436
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

739
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:10,103
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

740
00:57:10,212 --> 00:57:13,204
You! You can, Bolt,

741
00:57:13,315 --> 00:57:15,283
because all over this planet,

742
00:57:15,384 --> 00:57:18,353
there are animals
who feel like they can't.

743
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:25,050
Like a little hamster who once spent
his days in an RV park,

744
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:29,657
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

745
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:35,897
and be told, "You did it.
You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."

746
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:38,732
They need a hero, Bolt.

747
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:43,004
Someone who, no matter
what the odds, will do what's right.

748
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:47,411
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

749
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:51,952
can become possible
if you're awesome!

750
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:56,915
Well,
you're right about one thing, Rhino.

751
00:57:57,793 --> 00:57:59,784
Mittens does need a hero,

752
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:03,328
and I guess I'll have to do.

753
00:58:03,432 --> 00:58:08,335
Such modesty!
Now, who's going to save that cat?

754
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:10,405
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

755
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:11,563
Me.

756
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:15,769
I'll get my ball.

757
00:58:31,493 --> 00:58:32,824
Over there.

758
00:58:35,664 --> 00:58:37,063
There it is.

759
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:46,740
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

760
00:58:47,943 --> 00:58:50,377
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

761
00:58:50,479 --> 00:58:53,710
We're gonna have to do things
a little differently.

762
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,450
Stealth mode.

763
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,287
Good night, Ester.

764
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:05,019
Good night, Lloyd.

765
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:12,793
Lloyd?

766
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:18,203
Lloyd Spoon,
you jump out and scare me,

767
00:59:18,307 --> 00:59:20,901
and I'm gonna pepper-spray you again!

768
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:27,906
I swear, it's like I work with toddlers.

769
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,184
Threat nullified.

770
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:39,926
I feel alive.

771
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:41,086
Shh!

772
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,294
There's a guard.

773
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:48,960
I'll snap his neck.

774
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:51,005
We need to get him away
from that door.

775
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:52,130
Oh!

776
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:00,207
- Ball?
- Ball?

777
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:01,577
- Ball?
- Ball?

778
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:05,551
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

779
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:11,354
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

780
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:25,166
Mittens?

781
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:30,574
Bolt? What are you doing here?

782
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:32,470
I'm busting you out.

783
01:00:32,581 --> 01:00:37,018
You... You came all the way back here
for me?

784
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,211
Yeah.

785
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,380
But how'd you... I mean,
you don't have any superpowers.

786
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,048
- I know.
- Really?

787
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:46,321
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

788
01:00:46,428 --> 01:00:49,864
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

789
01:00:49,965 --> 01:00:51,796
- No.
- Me neither.

790
01:00:54,336 --> 01:00:58,796
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?

791
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:01,432
Hey, wait.
Where'd you get that hamster?

792
01:01:01,543 --> 01:01:03,238
Give it. Give it.

793
01:01:04,446 --> 01:01:05,538
Hey, wait!

794
01:01:05,647 --> 01:01:07,308
Initiating escape.

795
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:11,446
Ow!

796
01:01:11,553 --> 01:01:13,145
What the... Hey!

797
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,056
Lloyd! Block the door!

798
01:01:16,158 --> 01:01:18,058
Block the door, block the door,
block the door!

799
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,094
Superbark. Superbark!

800
01:01:43,552 --> 01:01:48,683
Sweet Sister Frances!
What did you do to my new truck?

801
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,757
You hold on right there!

802
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,859
Golly, Ester!

803
01:01:54,095 --> 01:01:56,928
Both you boys need serious help!

804
01:01:57,032 --> 01:01:58,363
Spicy eyes!

805
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,232
We need a ride.

806
01:02:03,338 --> 01:02:06,205
Ooh! I've got a big one. You're welcome.

807
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,090
I can't believe it.

808
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:28,288
My whole life I've wanted to see
a real live superbark.

809
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:33,128
You are legendary.

810
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:48,274
Mittens? lf...

811
01:02:49,484 --> 01:02:52,749
If I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

812
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:55,412
I mean, what...

813
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,260
Ah, don't worry about it.

814
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:04,423
Being a regular dog is, like,
the greatest gig in the world. Okay?

815
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:07,835
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

816
01:03:07,936 --> 01:03:10,200
A little-known cat secret.

817
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:12,068
You know why we hate dogs?

818
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:15,336
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

819
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:19,442
But what do dogs do?

820
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:22,176
Slobber, sleep,
chase tails, chew shoes.

821
01:03:22,284 --> 01:03:24,582
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

822
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:27,348
You know,
most dogs live in a place like this,

823
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:30,356
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

824
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,983
Out of this? But... But...

825
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:35,022
And this is your dog bowl.

826
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,122
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

827
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:40,428
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

828
01:03:40,535 --> 01:03:41,832
How cool is that?

829
01:03:43,138 --> 01:03:46,471
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

830
01:03:47,976 --> 01:03:49,671
It doesn't get better than that.

831
01:03:49,778 --> 01:03:53,305
You... You seem to know a lot
about these places.

832
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:55,406
Yeah, I did my time in one of these,

833
01:03:55,517 --> 01:03:57,781
but I'm more of an alley cat at heart,
you know?

834
01:03:57,886 --> 01:04:01,049
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

835
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:02,180
Hmm.

836
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:08,423
<i>Rhino is awesome!
He's so awesome!</i>

837
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,964
He's... He's beyond awesome!

838
01:04:11,066 --> 01:04:13,728
He... He's be-awesome!

839
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,164
He's...

840
01:04:17,005 --> 01:04:20,065
I... I am be-awesome.

841
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:24,236
Mmm.

842
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:25,702
Hmm!

843
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:31,013
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece <i>de rsistance.</i>

844
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:34,687
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

845
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:36,586
- Why?
- Just do it.

846
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:45,222
This... This is awesome!

847
01:04:46,735 --> 01:04:48,862
And stick your tongue out.

848
01:04:53,274 --> 01:04:56,437
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

849
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:59,172
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

850
01:05:06,454 --> 01:05:10,686
<i>I have got so much to give</i>

851
01:05:11,393 --> 01:05:14,487
<i>I swear I do</i>

852
01:05:14,996 --> 01:05:18,796
<i>I may not have nine lives</i>

853
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:22,794
<i>But this one feels brand-new</i>

854
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:27,439
<i>Yes, I've lived a good one</i>

855
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,709
<i>I have tried to be true</i>

856
01:05:31,813 --> 01:05:36,978
<i>There are some things
I never realized</i>

857
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:40,054
<i>Till I met you</i>

858
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:47,118
<i>How the wind feels on my cheeks</i>

859
01:05:48,797 --> 01:05:55,168
<i>When I'm barking at the moon</i>

860
01:05:57,672 --> 01:06:01,904
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

861
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:06,777
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

862
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:12,945
<i>Here I come</i>

863
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:17,155
<i>Back to you</i>

864
01:06:17,258 --> 01:06:21,558
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

865
01:06:21,663 --> 01:06:25,827
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

866
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:31,031
<i>Well, I was in trouble bad</i>

867
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:34,597
<i>I was so confused</i>

868
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:38,941
<i>I may not see in color, babe</i>

869
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:43,507
<i>But I sure can feel blue</i>

870
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:48,112
<i>I have been a lot of things</i>

871
01:06:48,223 --> 01:06:51,590
<i>They may not all be true</i>

872
01:06:51,693 --> 01:06:57,029
<i>My experience was so mysterious</i>

873
01:06:57,132 --> 01:07:00,192
<i>Till I met you</i>

874
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:07,207
<i>Now the sun will rise in the east</i>

875
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:15,540
<i>But I'm barking at the moon</i>

876
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:22,051
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

877
01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:26,526
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

878
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:33,126
<i>Here I come</i>

879
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:37,064
<i>Back to you</i>

880
01:07:37,172 --> 01:07:41,438
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

881
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:45,741
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

882
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:50,079
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

883
01:07:50,185 --> 01:07:54,349
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

884
01:07:54,455 --> 01:08:00,985
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>like the one you've got</i>

885
01:08:01,095 --> 01:08:07,864
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

886
01:08:17,283 --> 01:08:19,308
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

887
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:23,514
Come on. I've got a surprise for you.

888
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:30,294
Okay, okay. No peeking.
All right, now, open them.

889
01:08:33,432 --> 01:08:36,196
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

890
01:08:36,736 --> 01:08:39,102
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

891
01:08:39,205 --> 01:08:43,972
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

892
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,699
Mittens, I...

893
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:48,041
I found this really soft pillow thing
for you.

894
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:51,412
And get this. I found some Styrofoam,
and I stuffed it inside,

895
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:53,348
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

896
01:08:53,452 --> 01:08:54,441
You know what I mean?

897
01:08:54,553 --> 01:08:55,815
- Mittens, I don't think that...
- Ooh! Ooh!

898
01:08:55,921 --> 01:09:01,223
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

899
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:02,589
Yeah, well, I don't think that I...

900
01:09:02,695 --> 01:09:04,720
Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof.

901
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:07,731
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

902
01:09:10,202 --> 01:09:11,294
What?

903
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:13,838
We're one waffle away from Penny.

904
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:17,509
You're still going back to her?

905
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:20,839
Mittens, she's my person.

906
01:09:23,315 --> 01:09:24,680
Ow! Ow! Ow!

907
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,012
Ear, ear.

908
01:09:28,754 --> 01:09:31,691
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

909
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:34,558
Now, how about this? Is that real?

910
01:09:35,194 --> 01:09:39,460
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

911
01:09:40,032 --> 01:09:44,070
How about that, Bolt? She's an actress.

912
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:46,598
She's just pretending.

913
01:09:47,006 --> 01:09:48,268
Not Penny.

914
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:52,208
There is no Penny. She's fake.

915
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:53,801
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

916
01:09:53,913 --> 01:09:57,508
No, no, Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?

917
01:09:57,616 --> 01:10:01,017
They act like they love you.
They act like they'll be there forever,

918
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,055
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

919
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:06,317
and take their love with them,

920
01:10:06,425 --> 01:10:09,952
and leave their declawed cat behind
to fend for herself!

921
01:10:15,735 --> 01:10:21,935
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

922
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:25,838
I...

923
01:10:28,214 --> 01:10:30,079
I'm sorry, Mittens,

924
01:10:32,351 --> 01:10:34,216
but Penny is different.

925
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,184
Then go.

926
01:10:40,392 --> 01:10:42,986
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

927
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,387
I never should've taken pity on you.

928
01:10:47,466 --> 01:10:50,128
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

929
01:10:59,278 --> 01:11:01,143
You take care, Mittens.

930
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:41,742
That meat lover's pizza
is not loving me back at all.

931
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:44,952
Hey there, Rhino.

932
01:11:45,057 --> 01:11:46,615
Morning, cat.

933
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,393
Where's Bolt?

934
01:11:49,995 --> 01:11:51,155
He's...

935
01:11:53,032 --> 01:11:54,499
He's gone.

936
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,329
Bolt left?

937
01:11:57,136 --> 01:12:01,232
Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you

938
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:05,868
that he had to face
the Green-Eyed Man alone.

939
01:12:09,782 --> 01:12:10,771
Whoa!

940
01:12:10,883 --> 01:12:13,351
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

941
01:12:13,452 --> 01:12:15,750
But he doesn't need us anymore.

942
01:12:16,388 --> 01:12:19,721
Trust me,
I've seen it a million times before.

943
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:21,952
In the cold, dark
night before the battle,

944
01:12:22,061 --> 01:12:26,430
when the steely fangs of evil
are sharpened and poised to strike,

945
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:30,024
the hero must go
and face his greatest challenge alone.

946
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,632
But if Bolt's taught me anything,

947
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:37,505
it's that you never abandon a friend
in a time of need.

948
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:41,177
When your teammate's in trouble,
you go.

949
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,044
Whether they ask or not, you go,

950
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:46,174
not knowing if you're coming back
dead or alive...

951
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:48,378
He went the other way.

952
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:49,454
You go!

953
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:53,582
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to pierce your hide, you go.

954
01:13:17,483 --> 01:13:18,609
Penny.

955
01:13:20,686 --> 01:13:25,089
No way. Wow. Bolt.
I'm a really big fan of yours, brother.

956
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:26,817
I'm Blake.
This is my writing partner, Tom.

957
01:13:26,926 --> 01:13:28,325
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

958
01:13:28,427 --> 01:13:29,951
- Wow!
- Oh, no.

959
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:31,996
Oh. And this is our
personal assistant, Billy,

960
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:33,826
who was supposed
to wait up on the wire.

961
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,400
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

962
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:36,934
and there's something
I've always wanted to tell you

963
01:13:37,036 --> 01:13:38,367
if I ever got a chance to meet you,
and now it's...

964
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:40,199
Okay, Billy, that was horrifying,
what you just did.

965
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:41,330
Why don't you make yourself useful.

966
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,499
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

967
01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:45,509
Whole wheat is not the same thing
as whole grain, Billy!

968
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:47,340
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

969
01:13:47,446 --> 01:13:48,743
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

970
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:51,111
Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going.

971
01:13:51,216 --> 01:13:53,309
I know. I know you're a busy dog,
but if you've got a second,

972
01:13:53,419 --> 01:13:55,114
we'd love to pitch you an idea
for your show.

973
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,450
Tom's better at pitching.
I'll let him take it from here.

974
01:13:57,556 --> 01:13:59,353
Tommy's got the spotlight.

975
01:14:02,294 --> 01:14:03,784
Wait for it.

976
01:14:05,664 --> 01:14:07,928
- Aliens.
- Oh, snap!

977
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:11,093
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

978
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:13,467
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

979
01:14:13,572 --> 01:14:15,267
You can't touch us.

980
01:14:15,507 --> 01:14:17,134
Uh...

981
01:14:17,242 --> 01:14:19,437
I love it. But I'll tell you what.

982
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:23,777
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

983
01:14:23,882 --> 01:14:28,114
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

984
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,244
We got a nibble.

985
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:32,449
Don't freak out.
This is how you blew it with Nemo.

986
01:14:32,558 --> 01:14:35,994
We open, exterior, outer space,
late morning...

987
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:39,195
...a fiery comet to reveal Penny...

988
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:41,858
...faced by a man-eating squid!

989
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:54,436
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

990
01:14:54,546 --> 01:14:55,945
we fade to black.

991
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:58,380
And we have a great pop song
for the end credits.

992
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:00,952
Talk to your people.
We're ready to move on this.

993
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:02,645
He's so on board!

994
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,895
There it is!

995
01:15:16,769 --> 01:15:19,363
The most terrifying place on Earth.

996
01:15:34,086 --> 01:15:35,815
Hello.
How are you doing today?

997
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:38,257
Hi. I'm here to see Joe Mateo.

998
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:44,651
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

999
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:48,631
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

1000
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:50,224
Rhino! Hold up!

1001
01:15:52,104 --> 01:15:53,196
Hold up!

1002
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:56,001
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

1003
01:15:56,775 --> 01:16:01,576
Listen, this may be
really hard for you to understand,

1004
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,649
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

1005
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,514
I mean, sometimes, sometimes
you think something's really real

1006
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:09,018
and it's not. And sometimes...

1007
01:16:09,121 --> 01:16:12,454
All of my training has prepared me
for this moment.

1008
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:13,752
This is complicated.

1009
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:15,850
Die! Die!

1010
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,830
Prepare yourself,
foul man-beast,

1011
01:16:20,933 --> 01:16:23,834
for I will beat your pancreas
with your spleen,

1012
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:26,234
and then I will rip your liver
out of your...

1013
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:31,670
You're so cute with your little whiskers.

1014
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:34,906
I had a hamster just like you
when I was a kid.

1015
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:37,573
His name was Mr. Sparkles.

1016
01:17:05,344 --> 01:17:06,402
Bolt?

1017
01:17:08,914 --> 01:17:10,882
Bolt! You're okay!

1018
01:17:12,684 --> 01:17:14,276
You came back.

1019
01:17:23,128 --> 01:17:25,790
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

1020
01:17:38,977 --> 01:17:40,706
You're my good boy.

1021
01:18:06,338 --> 01:18:07,362
Good boy.

1022
01:18:07,472 --> 01:18:11,306
Okay, people. Let's move it
to stage seven and do it for real.

1023
01:18:19,017 --> 01:18:20,109
I miss him.

1024
01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:23,711
I know, honey. I do, too.

1025
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:29,059
First positions, please.

1026
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:42,538
Okay, hold still for me, sweetie.

1027
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,952
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

1028
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:58,955
And action.

1029
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:10,225
Ah!

1030
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:15,272
Professor, I'd like to thank you
for granting us access

1031
01:19:15,374 --> 01:19:19,538
to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

1032
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:22,239
You know I'd never do such a thing.

1033
01:19:22,347 --> 01:19:28,911
Unless it was the only way
to save your little girl's life!

1034
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:30,010
Penny!

1035
01:19:30,122 --> 01:19:33,455
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

1036
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:36,322
Your dog is nowhere near...

1037
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:43,192
Get that dog!

1038
01:19:47,839 --> 01:19:51,798
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy. Come here.

1039
01:19:58,317 --> 01:20:01,150
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

1040
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:09,184
Hey, Wags.

1041
01:20:10,862 --> 01:20:13,956
Mittens? What are you doing here?

1042
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,260
Long story short,

1043
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:19,235
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

1044
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:20,999
But that is not important now.

1045
01:20:21,106 --> 01:20:24,667
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

1046
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:27,336
And why aren't you in there?

1047
01:20:28,413 --> 01:20:30,813
You were right about her, Mittens.

1048
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:35,744
She... Well, it wasn't real.

1049
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:39,613
No, Bolt. It is real.
I was in there just now.

1050
01:20:39,725 --> 01:20:43,456
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenhearted.

1051
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:48,123
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you.

1052
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:54,564
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

1053
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:00,776
Bolt, you're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

1054
01:21:00,879 --> 01:21:02,847
Mittens, be quiet.

1055
01:21:02,948 --> 01:21:04,245
No. You need to hear this.

1056
01:21:04,349 --> 01:21:06,408
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

1057
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:09,184
What is it?

1058
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:11,978
Penny.

1059
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,321
Help! Please, help! Help!

1060
01:21:15,427 --> 01:21:16,655
Hold on!

1061
01:21:18,163 --> 01:21:19,926
Please! Help!

1062
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:36,876
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

1063
01:21:36,982 --> 01:21:39,584
Yeah. You better run.

1064
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:43,784
I'm on your six.

1065
01:21:43,889 --> 01:21:44,878
What do we do?

1066
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:47,720
Just make sure
I get inside that building.

1067
01:21:50,061 --> 01:21:51,463
Bolt?

1068
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:54,891
Is anyone still in there?

1069
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,524
I don't know.

1070
01:21:59,538 --> 01:22:01,028
Coming through.

1071
01:22:04,576 --> 01:22:07,636
It's a good day to die!

1072
01:22:07,746 --> 01:22:09,680
Not on my watch, rodent.

1073
01:22:38,877 --> 01:22:40,003
Bolt!

1074
01:22:54,059 --> 01:22:55,959
I knew you'd come back.

1075
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:19,508
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

1076
01:23:55,186 --> 01:23:56,346
Bolt.

1077
01:23:58,924 --> 01:24:01,586
Bolt, just go on out.

1078
01:24:03,695 --> 01:24:04,719
Go.

1079
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:08,298
It'll be okay.

1080
01:24:17,075 --> 01:24:18,872
You're my good boy.

1081
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:21,911
I love you.

1082
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:35,788
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

1083
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:07,151
Hey, did you hear that?

1084
01:25:07,258 --> 01:25:08,247
Yeah.
- What is that?

1085
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,351
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

1086
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:19,636
It's the superbark!

1087
01:25:20,972 --> 01:25:23,440
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

1088
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,566
Come on, let's go!

1089
01:25:37,822 --> 01:25:41,451
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

1090
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:49,361
All right, we got an RT coming
through, people. Make a hole!

1091
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:50,798
<i>For your own safety,</i>

1092
01:25:50,902 --> 01:25:53,234
<i>keep moving away
from the building.</i>

1093
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,778
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

1094
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:06,874
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

1095
01:26:06,985 --> 01:26:11,285
She's stable, but we're gonna
take her to the hospital just to be safe.

1096
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:22,227
I'm so sorry this happened.

1097
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,426
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

1098
01:26:24,536 --> 01:26:28,165
No mother should ever have to go
through something like this,

1099
01:26:28,273 --> 01:26:33,836
but I promise you
we're going to make this work for us.

1100
01:26:33,945 --> 01:26:38,314
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

1101
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:40,350
This is so great!

1102
01:26:41,453 --> 01:26:42,477
Ow!

1103
01:26:44,355 --> 01:26:46,152
We quit.

1104
01:26:46,257 --> 01:26:49,522
No, no! Wait!
Let's not make any rash decisions.

1105
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:52,253
Let's put a pin in it.

1106
01:27:04,342 --> 01:27:07,402
I'm afraid your injuries
were more severe

1107
01:27:07,512 --> 01:27:09,912
than we had previously thought,
my dear.

1108
01:27:10,014 --> 01:27:13,541
We had to completely reconstruct
your face.

1109
01:27:16,054 --> 01:27:17,453
Have a look.

1110
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:24,952
Well, at least Calico
won't be able to recognize me.

1111
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:30,798
Calico!

1112
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:44,239
Bolt!

1113
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,530
Aliens.

1114
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:13,439
That is totally unrealistic.

1115
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:16,440
Absolutely ridonculous.

1116
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:19,847
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

1117
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:23,853
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

1118
01:28:33,832 --> 01:28:35,629
Hey, silly doggy.

1119
01:28:41,406 --> 01:28:45,035
That's a keeper.
You wanna go play outside?

1120
01:28:45,143 --> 01:28:48,169
You wanna go play outside? Let's go!

1121
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:03,486
Does that dog look familiar?

1122
01:29:03,595 --> 01:29:07,463
Nope.
I never seen him before in my life.

1123
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:14,794
Come on.

1124
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:18,105
Bolt! Come on, buddy!

1125
01:29:18,209 --> 01:29:22,509
<i>There is no home</i>
<i>Like the one you've got</i>

1126
01:29:22,614 --> 01:29:29,417
<i>'Cause that home belongs to you</i>

1127
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:53,803
<i>Nobody listens to me</i>

1128
01:29:53,912 --> 01:29:56,107
<i>Don't hear a single
thing I've said</i>

1129
01:29:56,214 --> 01:29:58,512
<i>Say anything to soothe me</i>

1130
01:29:58,616 --> 01:30:00,914
<i>Anything to get you from my head</i>

1131
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:02,816
<i>Don't know how I really feel</i>

1132
01:30:02,921 --> 01:30:05,583
<i>The faith it takes</i>
<i>to make like I don't care</i>

1133
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:07,385
<i>Don't know how much it hurts</i>

1134
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:09,926
<i>To turn around</i>
<i>like you were never there</i>

1135
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:13,464
<i>Like somehow you could be replaced</i>

1136
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:18,959
<i>And I could walk away</i>
<i>from the promises we made</i>

1137
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,834
<i>And swore we'd never break</i>

1138
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,407
- <i>I thought I lost you</i>
- <i>I thought I lost you</i>

1139
01:30:23,508 --> 01:30:26,375
<i>When you ran away
to try to find me</i>

1140
01:30:26,477 --> 01:30:31,073
<i>I thought I'd never see</i>
<i>your sweet face again</i>

1141
01:30:31,182 --> 01:30:35,619
<i>I turned around and you were gone</i>
<i>And on and on the days went</i>

1142
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:40,214
<i>But I kept the moments
that we were in</i>

1143
01:30:40,325 --> 01:30:44,056
<i>'Cause I hoped in my heart</i>
<i>you'd come back to me, my friend</i>

1144
01:30:44,162 --> 01:30:46,528
<i>And now I got you</i>

1145
01:30:48,499 --> 01:30:51,627
<i>But I thought I lost you</i>

1146
01:30:54,339 --> 01:30:56,864
<i>I felt so empty out there</i>

1147
01:30:56,975 --> 01:30:59,068
<i>And there were days
I had my doubts</i>

1148
01:30:59,177 --> 01:31:01,202
<i>But I knew I'd find you somewhere</i>

1149
01:31:01,312 --> 01:31:03,872
<i>'Cause I knew I
couldn't live without</i>

1150
01:31:03,982 --> 01:31:06,974
<i>You in my life for one more day</i>

1151
01:31:08,486 --> 01:31:10,545
<i>And I swore I'd never break those</i>

1152
01:31:10,655 --> 01:31:13,146
- <i>Promises we made</i>
- <i>Promises we made</i>

1153
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:17,717
<i>I thought I lost you</i>
<i>When you ran away to try to find me</i>

<i>But I thought I lost you</i>

1160
01:31:45,356 --> 01:31:47,483
<i>I told myself I wouldn't sleep</i>

1161
01:31:47,592 --> 01:31:51,653
<i>Till I'd searched the world</i>
<i>from sea to sea</i>

1162
01:31:54,866 --> 01:31:59,235
<i>I made a wish upon a star</i>
<i>I turned around and there you were</i>

1163
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:02,534
- <i>Now here we are</i>
