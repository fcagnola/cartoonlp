00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>Make mine music</i>

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
<i>Make mine music</i>

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>And my heart will sing</i>

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>Make mine music</i>

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,300
<i>And it's always spring</i>

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,300
<i>All the world goes romancing</i>

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
<i>When melody fills the night</i>

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
<i>And even the stars go dancing</i>

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>To the music of the moonlight</i>

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,200
<i>Make mine music</i>

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>And I'll dream of you</i>

13
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>Make mine music</i>

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>And the dream comes true</i>

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>Music will play the shadows away</i>

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
<i>When everything seems to go wrong</i>

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,500
<i>So make mine music</i>

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>And life will be a song</i>

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>Make mine music</i>

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,100
<i>Gather round me, children,
and I'll tell a story</i>

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>Of the mountains
in the days when guns was law</i>

22
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>When two families got disputin'
It was bound to end in shootin'</i>

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,900
<i>So just listen
and I'll tell you what I saw</i>

24
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,700
<i>Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They was reckless mountain boys</i>

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>And they took up family feudin'
when they'd meet</i>

26
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Every durn time!

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,400
<i>They could shot each other quicker
than it took your eye to flicker</i>

28
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,900
<i>They could knock a squirrel's eye out
at 90 feet</i>

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
<i>All their fightin' started
one bright Sunday morning</i>

30
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
I remember!

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>Cos old Grandpa Coy
was full of mountain dew ...</i>

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,400
<i>Just as quiet as a church mouse</i>

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>He stole into the Martins' henhouse</i>

34
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,600
<i>Cos the Coys,
they needed eggs for breakfast too</i>

35
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,900
<i>After that they started out
to fight in earnest</i>

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>And they scarred the mountains up
with shot and shell</i>

37
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,700
<i>There was uncles, brothers, cousins</i>

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,300
<i>Why, they bumped them off by dozens</i>

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,700
<i>Just how many bit the dust
is hard to tell</i>

40
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,900
<i>Oh, the Martins and the Coys</i>

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,500
<i>They were reckless mountain boys</i>

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,800
<i>At the art of killin'
they became quite deft</i>

43
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
<i>Mighty deft</i>

44
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,900
<i>They all knowed they shouldn't do it</i>

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,800
<i>But before they hardly knew it</i>

46
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,000
<i>On each side
they only had one person left</i>

47
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,600
<i>Only one person left</i>

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
<i>Now, the sole remaining Martin
was a maiden</i>

49
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,500
<i>And as pretty as a picture was this Grace</i>

50
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,000
<i>- While the one survivin' boy
- Was the handsome Henry Coy</i>

51
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>And the folks all knew
they'd soon meet face to face</i>

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,100
- After her, Henry!
- Go get her, boy!

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,300
- Knock him off, Gracie!
- Shoot that Coy!

54
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,200
<i>So they finally met
upon a mountain pathway</i>

55
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,600
<i>And Henry Coy,
he aimed his gun at Grace</i>

56
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,500
<i>Right at Grace</i>

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>He was set to pull the trigger
when he saw her pretty figure</i>

58
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,100
<i>You could see
that love had kicked him in the face</i>

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,700
<i>Oh, the Martins and the Coys</i>

60
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,900
<i>They were reckless mountain boys</i>

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,800
<i>But they say their ghostly cussin'
gives you chills</i>

62
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,700
<i>Cos the hatchet sure was buried
when sweet Grace and Henry married</i>

63
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>It broke up the best durn feud
in these here hills</i>

64
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,600
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

65
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,600
<i>Way down yonder, not far off,
a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough</i>

66
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,100
<i>Do si do, little more dough,
chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough</i>

67
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>"Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child,
no, he lost his teeth a long time ago"</i>

68
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Now swing your partners,

69
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
And promenade the hall,

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>Same old road, same old train
Watch that monkey walk that rail</i>

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,900
<i>Now first couple out to the right</i>

72
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,800
<i>Go round that couple and take a peek</i>

73
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,700
<i>Come back to the centre
and shake your feet</i>

74
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
<i>Round that couple and peek once more</i>

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>Back in the centre and circle four</i>

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>Swing your partner and call your hound
Right foot up and left foot down</i>

77
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,900
<i>Bottom of your foot
make a hole in the ground</i>

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,300
<i>Now you're tall with a smile
Once and a half and go hog wild</i>

79
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,900
Sooey, hog, sooey!

80
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Look at him run!
What's the hurry, Henry?

81
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,200
<i>Now you may think
that this is where the story ended</i>

82
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,500
<i>But I'm tellin'you
them ghosts don't cuss no more</i>

83
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,100
<i>Cos since Grace and Henry wedded
they fight worse than all the rest did</i>

84
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,900
<i>And they carry on the feud
just like before</i>

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,400
<i>Roll along, blue bayou</i>

86
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,600
<i>Through the silv'ry foam</i>

87
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>In the deep
where sleepy shadows roam</i>

88
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,200
<i>While we roll, blue bayou</i>

89
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,200
<i>In your dreamy light</i>

90
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:05,500
<i>Memories echo in my heart tonight</i>

91
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,700
<i>I hear the echo of our song of love</i>

92
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,100
<i>Murmuring low</i>

93
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
<i>And here am I</i>

94
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,200
<i>Still haunted by</i>

95
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,500
<i>The ghost of long ago</i>

96
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,500
<i>Roll along, blue bayou</i>

97
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,600
<i>Through the silv'ry foam</i>

98
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:48,600
<i>Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home</i>

99
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,900
<i>Roll along, blue bayou</i>

100
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,400
<i>Through the silv'ry foam</i>

101
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>In the deep
where sleepy shadows roam</i>

102
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,300
<i>While we roll, blue bayou</i>

103
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,100
<i>In your dreamy light</i>

104
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:59,000
<i>Memories echo in my heart tonight</i>

105
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,500
<i>Roll along, blue bayou</i>

106
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,400
<i>Through the silv'ry foam</i>

107
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:43,000
<i>Roll the blue
and sleepy shadows home</i>

108
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,700
<i>Roll along, blue bayou</i>

109
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,900
<i>Through the silv'ry foam</i>

110
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:08,200
<i>Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home</i>

111
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,300
<i>Across the blue moon</i>

112
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,900
Boy!

113
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,100
<i>Hop in the old jalop and...</i>

114
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
<i>Head for the malted shop and...</i>

115
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,100
<i>All the cats join in</i>

116
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,500
<i>Down goes my last two bits</i>

117
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,100
<i>Comes up one banana split</i>

118
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,500
<i>And all the cats join in</i>

119
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
<i>Drop your jack in the old jukebox</i>

120
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>Play your favourite disc</i>

121
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,700
<i>When you dance with the bobby socks</i>

122
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>You dance at your own risk</i>

123
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,600
<i>RIP</i>

124
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,800
<i>Everybody swing</i>

125
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,400
<i>Yes, swing till the rafters ring</i>

126
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
<i>And all the cats join in</i>

127
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,800
<i>Rafters ringing, how they're swinging</i>

128
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,300
<i>All the cats join in</i>

129
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,100
<i>I'm so lonely and blue</i>

130
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,300
<i>When I'm without you</i>

131
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,500
<i>I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart.</i>

132
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>Without you</i>

133
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,700
<i>The joy and tears
that love endears</i>

134
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>Would have no meaning</i>

135
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,100
<i>If I didn't have you</i>

136
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,100
<i>To keep me dreaming</i>

137
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,100
<i>At the close of each day</i>

138
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,000
<i>When I'm without you</i>

139
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,900
<i>And my heart kneels to pray</i>

140
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,300
<i>I pray about you</i>

141
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,800
<i>You take a star</i>

142
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,600
<i>And lead it far away from heaven</i>

143
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,300
<i>And the star will be lost</i>

144
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,100
<i>As I'm lost without you</i>

145
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>At the close of each day</i>

146
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,400
<i>When I'm without you</i>

147
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>And my heart kneels to pray</i>

148
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,800
<i>I pray about you</i>

149
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>You take a star</i>

150
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,800
<i>And lead it far away from heaven</i>

151
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,100
<i>And the star will be lost</i>

152
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:48,000
<i>As I'm lost without you</i>

153
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,900
<i>Oh, what a lark
to ride out to the park</i>

154
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
<i>And just to see Casey</i>

155
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,200
<i>They travelled for miles
and they stand in the aisles</i>

156
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,200
<i>And just to see Casey</i>

157
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,100
<i>The ladies
don't understand baseball a bit</i>

158
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,100
<i>They don't know a strike
from a foul or a hit</i>

159
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
<i>But when they see Casey
that dame has got it</i>

160
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,800
<i>Casey, the pride of them all</i>

161
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>The outlook wasn't brilliant
for the Mudville nine that day</i>

162
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>The score was four to two</i>

163
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,500
<i>With but one inning left to play</i>

164
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,600
Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers,
it's the ninth inning!

165
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,100
It's the wind-up! The blow-off!
Come on, unbutton your shirts!

166
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Now get in there and fight!
Who's up next?

167
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,500
Cooney!

168
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,500
The coach was really worried
when Cooney went to bat

169
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,700
For all he had to offer
was 300 pounds of fat

170
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,700
Ah, but Cooney was determined,
he tried to do his worst

171
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,500
He kept his batting average, all right

172
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
And as usual died at first

173
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
You're out!

174
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray!

175
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,000
- Aw, shut up!
- Sit down!

176
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,200
- I'll kick the stuffin' out of him!
- Yeah, run that guy outta town!

177
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,000
Barrows was the next one up,
and Barrows made a hit

178
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,800
Wow, he smacked a beauty -
right in the pitcher's mitt

179
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,300
You're out!

180
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,500
A straggling few got up to go

181
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,700
Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat

182
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,900
They'd put up even money now
were Casey at the bat

183
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey

184
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,900
Of all the stupid guys

185
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,100
The bat is getting in his hair

186
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,200
Now the hair is getting in his bat

187
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,600
Egad! He let drive a single -
much to his own surprise

188
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,000
Safe!

189
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,700
The next one in the line-up
was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake

190
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,000
Of all the mugs in Mudville
he was the biggest fake

191
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,000
But he was really blazing
and to the wonderment of all

192
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,300
Blake the Fake
tore the cover off the ball

193
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And when the dust had lifted
and they saw what had occurred

194
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,200
There was Jimmy safe at second
and Flynn a-huggin' third

195
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,400
Cosy, isn't it?

196
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,400
You're safe!

197
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,000
We want Casey! We want Casey!
We want Casey!

198
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>Oh, Casey's the guy
with his eye on the ball</i>

199
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
<i>But mostly the ladies</i>

200
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
<i>Casey's the guy who's the idol of all</i>

201
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
<i>But mostly the ladies</i>

202
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,600
<i>Casey is mighty and manly</i>

203
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,600
<i>Casey's a dangerous gent</i>

204
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,300
<i>Egad, when he goes to bat,
hang onto your hat</i>

205
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
<i>He's batting a thousand percent
with the ladies</i>

206
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,800
<i>Oh, Casey has nerve
and he knows every curve</i>

207
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,400
<i>He's no hokey-pokey</i>

208
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,800
<i>He gets away
with that old double play</i>

209
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,200
<i>He's sure okey-dokey</i>

210
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
<i>He makes all the ladies go gaga,
it's true</i>

211
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
<i>No wonder they swoon
when he comes into view</i>

212
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,200
<i>He was the Sinatra of 1902</i>

213
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,700
<i>Casey, the pride of them all</i>

214
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,900
The pitcher's nerves were jagged
and his knees began to shake

215
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me!

216
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,500
One eye was watching Flynn
and the other eye watching Blake

217
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,700
While the frightened pitcher
ground the ball into his hip

218
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,400
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye

219
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,100
A sneer curled Casey's lip

220
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,500
And now the leather-covered sphere
came hurtling through the air

221
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,900
And Casey stood a-watching it
in haughty grandeur there

222
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,500
Close by the sturdy batsman
the ball unheeded sped

223
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,700
"That ain't my style," said Casey

224
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,800
Strike one!

225
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>... the umpire said</i>

226
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,800
From the benches, black with people,
there went up a mighty roar

227
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,200
Like the beating of the ocean
on a stern and distant shore

228
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,900
Kill him! Kill the umpire!

229
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,400
<i>... yelled the cutie from the stand</i>

230
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,700
And it's likely they'd have killed him
Had not Casey raised his hand

231
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,800
With a smile of Christian charity
great Casey's visage shone

232
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,100
He stilled the rising tumult
and bade the game go on

233
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,800
He signalled to the pitcher
and once more the spheroid flew

234
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,100
But Casey still ignored it
and the umpire said, quote:

235
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,000
Strike two!

236
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,400
Unquote.

237
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,400
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands,
and the echo answered "Fraud!"

238
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,400
But one scornful look from Casey...

239
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,100
And the audience was awed

240
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,400
They saw his face grow stern and cold

241
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
They saw his muscles strain

242
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,200
And they knew that Casey
would not let that ball go by again

243
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,700
The sneer has gone from Casey's lip
His teeth are clenched in hate

244
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,100
He pounds with cruel violence
his bat upon the plate

245
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,500
And now the pitcher holds the ball

246
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,100
And now he lets it go

247
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,800
And now the air is shattered
by the force of Casey's blow

248
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,900
<i>Somewhere in this favoured land</i>

249
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,900
<i>The sun is shining bright</i>

250
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,700
<i>Ah, yes...</i>

251
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,900
<i>Somewhere bands are playing sweet</i>

252
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,400
<i>And somewhere hearts are light</i>

253
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,800
<i>Somewhere men are laughing</i>

254
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,300
<i>Somewhere children shout</i>

255
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
But there is no joy in Mudville -

256
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Mighty Casey has struck out

257
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,200
<i>Casey, the pride of them all!</i>

258
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Whaddaya know? The game is over.

259
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,700
<i>Two silhouettes</i>

260
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>Together in the afterglow</i>

261
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,000
<i>Two silhouettes</i>

262
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,300
<i>Become as one</i>

263
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>When lights are low</i>

264
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,400
<i>And with the night slumbering on</i>

265
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,300
<i>We'll build a dream for two</i>

266
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,500
<i>A perfect dream</i>

267
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,600
<i>Set to a theme lovely as you</i>

268
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,100
<i>Two hearts on fire</i>

269
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,400
<i>Will soon inspire</i>

270
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,000
<i>The stars to dance</i>

271
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,200
<i>The flames that stray</i>

272
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,400
<i>Will light the way</i>

273
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,100
<i>To our romance</i>

274
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,300
<i>And when I hold you in my arms</i>

275
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,300
<i>To my heart's delight</i>

276
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:39,400
<i>Two silhouettes
will drift away into the night</i>

277
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,500
<i>Two hearts on fire</i>

278
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,100
<i>Will soon inspire</i>

279
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,700
<i>The stars to dance</i>

280
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,100
<i>The flames that stray</i>

281
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,400
<i>Will light the way</i>

282
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,000
<i>To our romance</i>

283
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:15,300
<i>And when I hold you in my arms</i>

284
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>To my heart's delight</i>

285
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,400
<i>Two silhouettes</i>

286
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,700
<i>Will drift away</i>

287
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,600
<i>Into the night</i>

288
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,000
<i>Will drift away</i>

289
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:52,500
<i>Into the night</i>

290
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Now, this is the story of...

291
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,400
<i>Peter and the Wolf.</i>

292
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,200
<i>As you know, in the musical score
of Peter and the Wolf</i>

293
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,800
each character is represented
by an instrument in the orchestra -

294
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,600
Peter by the string quartet.

295
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,000
The bird, whose name is Sasha,
by a flute, way up high.

296
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,700
Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this...

297
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,300
And here is Ivan, the cat,

298
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,700
represented by a clarinet
in a very low register.

299
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,000
Grandpapa is an old bassoon.

300
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,900
The shooting of the hunters' guns
by the kettledrums.

301
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,600
And there is also a wolf.

302
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,900
Little does that wolf know
what's in store for him this day.

303
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,200
For our hero, little Peter,
armed to the teeth,

304
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,700
is setting forth to capture him.

305
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,900
There seems to have been
a change of plans.

306
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,200
For Peter's grandpapa
thinks that little boys like Peter

307
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,900
should not go out to hunt the wolf.

308
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,200
This is very embarrassing
for a great hunter.

309
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,500
This is Sasha,
the little bird we told you about.

310
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,400
Excitable little chap, isn't he?

311
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Forgetful, too.

312
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,700
"Hello, Petey. Where you goin'?
Can I go, Petey? Can I?"

313
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,100
"Oh, boy, a gun!"

314
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
"Loaded, too. "

315
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,000
"Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!"

316
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,200
"Everything's OK, Petey.
Come on, let's go. "

317
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
The wolf!

318
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,800
But it isn't the wolf at all.
It's only Sonia the duck.

319
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
"Hello, Sonia. "
"Hello, Petey. "

320
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,300
Now Sonia wants to join the party.

321
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Imagination is a wonderful thing.

322
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,900
But sometimes it can run away with you.

323
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
"You coward!"

324
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Now who's this?

325
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Oh, it can't be...

326
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,200
Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat.

327
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,000
Hello, Ivan.

328
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,400
Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe
a little shy on brains. You know the type.

329
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,600
Hey, look out, Sasha!

330
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,500
"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"

331
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:28,200
Oh, how can they ever get any place if
they're going to fight among themselves?

332
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,100
Ivan, you ought to be ashamed.

333
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,300
"You big bully!"
"You cat in the grass!"

334
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,700
Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry.
He won't do it again.

335
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,200
And so, once more,
our little band of intrepid hunters

336
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,200
sets forth to find the wolf.

337
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,500
And they find him.

338
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,400
Sonia! Sonia!
Behind you! Look out!

339
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,800
W-O-L-F!

340
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,500
Oh, that wolf is everywhere!
Peter, do something!

341
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,500
Oh, no.

342
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Look, Peter, why don't you...
Maybe if you could...

343
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,500
Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well...

344
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,500
Peter, don't just stand that way.

345
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,000
Don't stand that way, either.

346
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,600
Oh, Sonia!

347
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,900
This is no time to relax.

348
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,900
Poor Sonia.

349
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,200
Well, that's one gone.

350
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Goodbye, Sonia.

351
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,600
Will this crime go unavenged?

352
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,300
Not if little Sasha can help it.

353
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,000
You beast!

354
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,000
Take this! And this! And this!

355
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
How do you like this, eh?

356
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,900
And this, eh?

357
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,500
How about this, eh?

358
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,700
Not so good, eh?

359
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Good work, Sasha!

360
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,700
Trouble.

361
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,400
Sasha! Sasha, get up!

362
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,700
Get up! Get out of there!

363
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,400
Look out, please, for over-confidence.

364
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
This is bad.

365
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,600
This is very bad.

366
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
Saved!

367
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,600
Just when things are looking blackest...

368
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,100
Hark! What's that we hear?

369
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,200
What's this we see?

370
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,300
The hunters!
Misha, Yasha and Vladimir.

371
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,700
That's Vladimir in the middle.

372
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,200
Wait a minute, I'll show you.

373
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,200
W-O-L-F. Wolf.

374
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,300
Wolf?

375
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,700
To the rescue!

376
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,400
Oh, Peter, you're safe!

377
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,400
You've captured the wolf.

378
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,700
Oh, happy day!

379
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,400
I think I'll say that again.
Oh, happy day!

380
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,600
Oh, Peter, what a hero!

381
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,400
You too, Ivan.

382
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,200
Everybody's happy - except the wolf.

383
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,100
But little Sasha isn't happy.

384
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,900
He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia.

385
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,000
Sonia...

386
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,800
Sonia?

387
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,500
Sonia! Then you're not dead!
You're safe!

388
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Oh, Sonia,
this is the most wonderful, wonderful day!

389
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,600
The wolf is captured - Peter caught him!

390
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,100
One, two, three...

391
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:52,100
<i>Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet</i>

392
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:57,200
<i>In the window of a department store</i>

393
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,700
<i>'Twas love at first sight</i>

394
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,400
<i>And they promised one night</i>

395
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,700
<i>They'd be sweethearts for evermore</i>

396
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,300
<i>Johnnie would serenade Alice</i>

397
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,000
<i>Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu</i>

398
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,600
<i>He sang of a beautiful palace</i>

399
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,500
<i>Of a beautiful hatbox for two</i>

400
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,500
<i>But Johnnie Fedora
lost Alice Bluebonnet</i>

401
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:42,100
<i>To a patron of the department store</i>

402
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:47,300
<i>Her beauty was sought by
the girl she was bought by</i>

403
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,900
<i>For twenty-three ninety-four</i>

404
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,300
<i>Johnnie, O Johnnie</i>

405
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,700
<i>Your Alice Bluebonnet</i>

406
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:08,700
<i>Will always be waiting for you</i>

407
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,600
<i>So don't give up hoping</i>

408
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,300
<i>And don't give up dreaming</i>

409
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:26,900
<i>For true love will come smiling through</i>

410
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,900
<i>Johnnie Fedora
was lonely and stranded</i>

411
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,300
<i>In the window of the department store</i>

412
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,000
<i>When, lo and behold</i>

413
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,200
<i>He was suddenly sold</i>

414
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,000
<i>And his heart became gay once more</i>

415
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,300
<i>Johnnie sang out like a robin</i>

416
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,500
<i>Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu</i>

417
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,400
<i>To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin'</i>

418
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,100
<i>"I thought you were someone I knew "</i>

419
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,900
<i>He looked for her uptown
and crosstown and downtown</i>

420
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,900
<i>From the Brooklyn Bridge
to the Jersey shore</i>

421
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,500
<i>It all seemed in vain</i>

422
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,300
<i>Till he heard the refrain</i>

423
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,500
<i>Of the song Alice sang of yore</i>

424
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,900
<i>Johnnie, O Johnnie!</i>

425
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,500
<i>Your Alice Bluebonnet</i>

426
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:49,500
<i>Will always be waiting for you</i>

427
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,200
<i>So don't give up hoping</i>

428
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,900
<i>And don't give up dreaming</i>

429
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,300
<i>For true love will come smiling through</i>

430
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,600
<i>Johnnie kept yearning,
he kept on returning</i>

431
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,900
<i>To the window of the department store</i>

432
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,300
<i>His voice became hushed</i>

433
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,100
<i>He was literally crushed</i>

434
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
<i>And it started to rain and pour</i>

435
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,200
<i>Each place he went he kept calling</i>

436
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,700
<i>- Toora-lay
- Toora-li</i>

437
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,200
<i>- Toora-lu
- La la la</i>

438
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,900
<i>His spirits kept falling and falling</i>

439
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,200
<i>For his Alice was nowhere in view</i>

440
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,300
<i>But hey-noni-noni,
an ice man found Johnnie</i>

441
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,200
<i>And he cut him
to fit on his horse's ears</i>

442
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,800
<i>'Twas done without malice</i>

443
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,100
<i>For beside him was Alice</i>

444
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:48,900
<i>And they lived on for years and years</i>

445
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,300
Giddup!

446
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,700
<i>You Johnnie Fedoras</i>

447
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,000
<i>You Alice Bluebonnets</i>

448
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,300
<i>Whenever you find yourself blue</i>

449
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,200
<i>You'll find it's June in December</i>

450
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,600
<i>If you just remember</i>

451
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,600
<i>That true love will come smiling through</i>

452
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:19,300
<i>That true love will come smiling through</i>

453
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:11,100
<i>This is how it all began</i>

454
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,200
<i>Just a little back-page item
about a voice that sang at sea</i>

455
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,600
<i>And then this fantastic news appeared
on the front page</i>

456
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:30,800
<i>And then in screaming headlines</i>

457
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,700
Extra! Read all about it! Paper!

458
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,400
<i>A singing whale?</i>

459
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,900
<i>- Whaddaya know ?
- Imagine that</i>

460
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
<i>Huh! I don't believe it</i>

461
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
<i>I don't believe it</i>

462
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,600
<i>For who ever heard
of an operatic whale?</i>

463
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,500
<i>I don't believe it</i>

464
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
<i>I don't believe it</i>

465
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,200
<i>And headline followed headline</i>

466
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,900
<i>Then doctors and experts</i>

467
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,800
<i>And men of anatomical biology</i>

468
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,100
<i>Debated and argued</i>

469
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,200
<i>And quoted ichthyology</i>

470
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,200
<i>Impossible! Preposterous!</i>

471
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,100
<i>We savagely deny it</i>

472
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,900
<i>Magnificent! Miraculous!</i>

473
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,100
<i>We certainly certify it</i>

474
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,000
<i>And even the great impresario</i>

475
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,900
<i>Of the Grand Opera</i>

476
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,100
<i>Raised an eyebrow</i>

477
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,000
<i>And tried and tried to figure it out</i>

478
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:53,100
This whale, she's maybe
swallowed an opera singer.

479
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,100
That's it! This whale,
she's a-swallowed an opera singer!

480
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,300
I find-a the great Signor Donatelli
in-a the fish market.

481
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,100
I discovered the great Lilli Garli
in-a the honky-tonky.

482
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,400
Why not I find-a the opera singer
in-a the belly of a whale, huh?

483
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,400
I do it!

484
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,400
<i>Oh, get me a great big schooner
and get me a good harpooner</i>

485
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,700
<i>Photographers and reporters
from all the newspapers</i>

486
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,900
<i>Publicity! Publicity!</i>

487
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,300
<i>Publicity!</i>

488
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,600
Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull,
it was opportunity -

489
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,900
the big opportunity
for his friend Willie the whale.

490
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,100
There was no time to lose.
He must bring these two together.

491
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,300
Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now.

492
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,500
And Tetti-Tatti
was in for a wonderful surprise.

493
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,600
Because Willie
hadn't swallowed any opera singer,

494
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,400
he could really sing.

495
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,600
Listen.

496
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,100
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin', shortnin'</i>

497
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,200
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin' bread</i>

498
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,500
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin', shortnin'</i>

499
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,500
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin' bread</i>

500
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,400
<i>Two little chillun, lyin' in bed</i>

501
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,600
<i>One of 'em sick
and the other 'most dead</i>

502
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,700
<i>Called for the doctor,
the doctor said</i>

503
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,400
<i>"Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread"</i>

504
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,800
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin', shortnin'</i>

505
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,100
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin' bread</i>

506
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,700
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin', shortnin'</i>

507
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,100
<i>Mamma's little baby
loves shortnin' bread</i>

508
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,700
After all these years of casting
his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters,

509
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,500
now at last
success lay just over the waves.

510
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,600
Willie! Willie, look!

511
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,700
That's you, Willie!
He's looking for you!

512
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,400
It's your big opportunity.

513
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,000
Willie's going to be a great star.

514
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,700
Our Willie, going to sing grand opera.

515
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,000
<i>Goodbye, my friends.
I'm off to be discovered</i>

516
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,200
<i>I'm off to be discovered</i>

517
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:23,800
At last, the long years of patient waiting,
the endless hours of faithful practice

518
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,900
were about to be rewarded.

519
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,900
As Willie sped to his audition

520
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,900
he wondered what to sing
for his opening number.

521
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,300
<i>What would impress this impresario?
How about a bit of Figaro?</i>

522
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,600
<i>Yes, sure, Figaro.</i>

523
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,300
There she's blows! There she's blows!

524
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,600
Figaro.

525
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Figaro!

526
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,000
Figaro!

527
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,600
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!

528
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,700
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!

529
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,400
Figaro!

530
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,000
Shoot-a de whale!

531
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,800
Figaro!

532
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,000
Figaro!

533
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,100
Figaro!

534
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,800
Hurry up, hurry up!
Rescue the opera singer!

535
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,800
Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you!

536
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,200
Bravo!

537
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,800
<i>Bravissimo! Bravo!</i>

538
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,700
Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it.

539
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,900
They hadn't even heard a third of it.

540
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,600
For Willie was no ordinary singing whale.

541
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,600
Willie could sing in three separate voices:

542
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,700
tenor...

543
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,700
baritone...

544
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,700
and bass.

545
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,300
Why, Willie was a singing miracle.

546
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,900
Let-a me up! This is the mutiny!

547
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,300
<i>Mamma mia!
He's-a swallowed two opera singers!</i>

548
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,500
He's-a swallowed three opera singers!

549
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,400
Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti.

550
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,900
For right before his very eyes was the
biggest discovery in all musical history.

551
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,800
Just imagine, a whale singing opera

552
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,500
on the very stage of the Met.

553
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,900
<i>Bravo! Bravissimo!</i>

554
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,400
<i>Je suis Méphisto</i>

555
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,100
<i>Roi d'enfer</i>

556
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,700
<i>Je veux...</i>

557
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:23,100
<i>Ta vie</i>

558
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,400
I got him! I got him!

559
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,200
<i>Vittoria!</i>

560
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,200
Now Willie will never sing at the Met.

561
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:21,000
But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti.
He just didn't understand.

562
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:27,200
You see, Willie's singing was a miracle,
and people aren't used to miracles.

563
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,200
And you, faithful little friend,
don't be too sad.

564
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,600
Because miracles never really die,

565
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:40,600
and somewhere in whatever heaven
is reserved for creatures of the deep,

566
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,800
Willie is still singing -

567
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,900
in a hundred voices,
each more golden than before.

568
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,100
And he'll go on singing, amid
the applause and the cheering, forever.

569
01:13:54,305 --> 01:14:54,413
