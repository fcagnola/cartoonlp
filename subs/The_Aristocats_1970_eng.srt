93
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,823
Aaah!

94
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,532
Still the softest
hands in all Paris.

95
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,324
You're a shameless
flatterer, Georges.

96
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,294
Adelaide, that's music.

97
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,204
It's from Carmen, isn't it?

98
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,295
That's right. It was
my favourite role.

99
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,380
Yes, yes.

100
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,468
It was the night of your grand
premiere that we first met. Remember?

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,134
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.

102
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,646
Champagne, dancing
the night away...

103
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,321
Oh, Georges.

104
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,831
Oh, ho!

105
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,792
Thank goodness.

106
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,054
Just in time.

107
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,055
Ah, Georges.

108
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:07,515
We're just a pair of
sentimental old fools.

109
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,693
Now, Georges, do be serious.

110
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,531
I've asked you to come here on
a very important legal matter.

111
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,032
Oh? Oh!

112
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,989
Splendid, splendid.

113
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,279
Who do you want me to sue, eh?

114
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,540
Come now, Georges. I don't
wish you to sue anyone.

115
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,871
I simply want to make my will.

116
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,538
Will, eh? Will, will...

117
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,337
Now, then, who are
the beneficiaries?

118
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,098
Well, as you know, I have
no living relatives.

119
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,260
Naturally, I want my beloved cats

120
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,554
to be always well-cared for.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,566
Certainly, no one can do this better
than my faithful servant, Edgar.

122
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,192
Edgar?

123
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,322
Adelaide, you mean to say you're
leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?

124
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:05,240
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?

125
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,700
This mansion? Your country chateau?

126
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,206
Your treasures, jewels, and...?

127
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,538
Oh, no, no, Georges.

128
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,545
- To my cats.
- To your cats?

129
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,751
Cats?

130
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,039
Yes, Georges.

131
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,255
I simply wish to have
the cats inherit first.

132
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,219
Then, at the end of their lifespan,
my entire estate will revert to Edgar.

133
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,429
Cats inherit first?

134
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,264
And I come after the cats.

135
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,429
I, me, after...

136
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,438
It's... it's not fair.

137
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,599
Whoo! I mean, whoo.

138
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,439
Each cat will live about 12 years.

139
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,945
I can't wait... And each
cat has nine lives.

140
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,902
That's four times 12...

141
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,987
Multiply by nine times...

142
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,871
No, it's less than that. Anyway,
it's much longer than I'd ever live.

143
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,365
I'll be gone.

144
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,034
No.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,874
Oh, no. They'll be gone.

146
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,165
I'll think of a way.

147
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,129
Oh... there are a million
reasons why I should.

148
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,135
All of 'em dollars.

149
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,963
Millions.

150
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,767
Those cats have got to go.

151
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,138
Wait for me, wait for me!

152
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,774
Me first, me first. Whoo.

153
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,525
Why should you be first?

154
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,233
Because I'm a lady, that's why.

155
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,363
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.

156
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,695
You're nothin' but a sister.

157
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,492
Oh!

158
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,156
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.

159
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,254
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.

160
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,261
Fight fair, Marie.

161
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,548
Females never fight fair.

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,342
Ow! Now, that hurt.

163
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,931
Mama! Mama!

164
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,517
Marie, darling, Marie,
you must stop that.

165
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,602
This, this is really not ladylike.

166
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,314
And Berlioz?

167
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,447
Such behaviour is most unbecoming
to a lovely gentleman.

168
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,528
Well, she started it.

169
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,446
Ladies do not start fights,
but they can finish them.

170
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,364
Berlioz.

171
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,999
Now, don't be rude.

172
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,956
We were just practising
biting and clawing.

173
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,295
Aristocrats do not practise
biting and clawing

174
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,458
and things like that.
That's just horrible.

175
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,424
But someday we might
meet a tough alley cat.

176
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,931
That will do.

177
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,519
It's time we concerned ourself
with self-improvement.

178
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,231
You want to grow up to be lovely
charming ladies and gentlemens.

179
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,317
Now, Toulouse, you go and
start on with your painting.

180
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,696
Yes, Mama.

181
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,913
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint
before we start our music lesson?

182
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,493
Please?

183
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,454
Well, yes, my love, but...

184
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,039
- Whoops.
- ...you must be very quiet.

185
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,579
Uh-Oh.

186
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,249
Mm-hm. Mm-mm-hm.

187
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,678
Uh-huh.

188
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,028
Yeah.

189
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,531
It's Edgar.

190
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,283
Yeah, old pickle-puss Edgar.

191
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,618
"Old pickle-puss"? Now, now.

192
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,123
Berlioz, that is not kind.

193
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,956
You know Edgar is so
fond of all of us

194
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,291
and takes very good care of us.

Oops. Oh, dear.

201
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,645
Slip of the hand and
it's off to dreamland.

202
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,404
I say, that's not at all bad.

203
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,691
Slip of the hand... dreamland.

204
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,825
Let's leave Toulouse
to his painting.

205
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,450
Now, dear, you go to
the piano. Now, run along.

206
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,081
Both of you, go ahead.

207
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,494
Yes, Mama.

208
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,834
It's time to practise your
scales and your arpeggios.

Mama, he did it again.

00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,493

214
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:02,499

Oh. Good evening, my little ones.

238
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,653
Your favourite dish,
prepared a very special way.

239
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,323
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.

240
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,244
Sleep well... I mean,
eat well, of course.

241
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,686
Good evening, Duchess.

242
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,724
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.

243
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,018
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.

244
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,609
Mm. Something smells awfully good.

245
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,617
What is that appetising smell?

246
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,619
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.

247
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,031
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?

248
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,121
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.

249
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,831
But...

250
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,500
But it so happens that I
have a cracker with me.

251
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,633
Come on, Roquefort, have some.

252
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,387
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.

253
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,889
Just a few dunks.

254
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,310
Mm. Oooh. Very good.

255
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,972
My compliments to the chef.

256
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,641
Mm. This is yummy.

257
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,275
Mm.

258
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,562
Delicious.

259
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,901
Double delicious.

260
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,654
This calls for another cracker.

261
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,989
I'll be right back.

262
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,425
So that's...

263
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,384
crème de la crème...

264
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,798
a la...

265
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,592
Edgar.

266
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,705
Ahhh!

267
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,455
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.

268
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,666
Lafayette!

269
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,047
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.

270
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,003
Wheels approaching.

271
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,420
Oh, Napoleon, we done
bit six tyres today.

272
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,556
Chased four motorcars and
a bicycle and a scooter.

273
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,341
Hush your mouth.

274
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,101
It's a motorcycle.

275
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,389
Two-cylinder, chain drive,

276
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,185
one squeaky wheel on
the front, it sounds like.

277
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:07,697
You go for the tyres, and I'll go
right for the seat of the problem.

278
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,734
How come you always grab the
tender part for yourself?

279
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,529
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.

280
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,869
Now, stop beating your
gums and sound the attack.

281
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,250
No, that's mess call.

282
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,005
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?

283
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,087
You can be replaced, you know.

284
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,593
OK, let's charge. Oooh.

285
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,005
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.

286
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm the one that says when we go.

287
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,676
Here we go.

288
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,470
Charge!

289
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,299
Whew.

290
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,638
Ahh! Oww!

291
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,971
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!

292
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,522
Yow!

293
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,482
This sure beats running, Napoleon.

294
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,617
Step on the gas, Napoleon.

295
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,653
I got 'er wide open.

296
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,219
Oww!

297
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,708
Oh!

298
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,418
Oh, where am I?

299
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,751
I'm not at home at all.

300
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,759
Children, where are you? Answer me.

301
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,431
Berlioz?

302
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,717
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?

303
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,727
Here I am, Mama.

304
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,562
Marie, darling. Well,
are you all right?

305
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,900
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare
and fell out of bed.

306
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,611
Now, Marie, darling,
don't be frightened.

307
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,946
Mama! Mama!

308
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,782
That's Berlioz.

309
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,072
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.

310
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,037
And don't worry. Everything's
going to be all right.

311
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,951
I'm coming, Mama.

312
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,755
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.

313
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,588
Mama?

314
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,923
Mama!

315
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,302
Darling.

316
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,927
That's only a little frog, my love.

317
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,312
He had a mouth like
a hippo-lotamus.

318
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,148
Oh, what's so funny?

319
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,155
Not now, darling. Darlings,
you just stay here.

320
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,818
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?

321
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,986
Toulouse, where are you?

322
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,248
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!

323
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,749
Toulouse!

324
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,333
Hey! What's all the
yelling about, huh?

325
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,588
Why didn't you answer?

326
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,342
Mama, he's been here all the time.

327
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,002
Oh, thank goodness.

328
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,046
Are you all right?

329
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,591
I was having a funny dream.

330
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,681
Edgar was in it.

331
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,471
And we were all riding
and bouncing along...

332
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,689
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.

333
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,025
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?

334
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,112
Oh, darling, why, that's...

335
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,026
Why, that's ridiculous.

336
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,117
Yeah, maybe you fell on
your head, Toulouse.

337
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,460
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.

338
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,247
Now, my darling, don't be
frightened. You'll see...

339
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,802
Oh, dear. Let's get into
the basket, all of us.

340
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,305
What's gonna happen to us?

341
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,137
Well, darlings, I just don't know.

342
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,802
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?

343
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,145
I wish we were home
with Madame right now.

344
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, poor Madame.

345
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,151
She will be so worried
when she finds us gone.

346
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,408
Duchess? Kittens?

347
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,197
Oh, my gracious.

348
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,664
I had the most horrible
dream about them.

349
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,755
Thank goodness it was only a dream.

350
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,295
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.

351
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,588
Now, now, my darlings.

352
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,679
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.

353
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,188
Oh, no! They're gone.

354
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,941
Duchess! Kittens!

355
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,104
Duchess! Where are you?

356
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,774
They're gone. They're gone!

357
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,285
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?

358
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,242
Why, that's terrible.

359
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,247
But where? Why?

360
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:37,003
Good heavens. Anything could
happen to them on a night like this.

361
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:42,418
Get washed down a storm
drain, struck by lightning...

362
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,085
Oh, they'll need help.

363
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,637
I've just got to find them.

364
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,802
Duchess! Kittens?

365
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,024
Duchess!

366
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,110
Kittens!

367
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,325

Bravo.

416
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,493
Very good. You are a great talent.

417
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,502
Oh, thank you.

418
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,663
And what might your name be?

419
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,672
My name is Duchess.

420
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,879
Duchess.

421
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,592
Beautiful. Love it.

422
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,848
And those eyes.

423
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,349
Oooh.

424
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:23,354
Why, your eyes are like
sapphires sparkling so bright.

425
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,312
They make the morning
radiant and light.

426
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,650
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.

427
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,691
Very poetic.

428
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,360
But it is not quite Shakespeare.

429
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,656
Of course not. That's
pure O'Malley, baby.

430
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,244
Right off the cuff.

431
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,000
I got a million of them.

432
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,751
Oh, no more, please.

433
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,459
I am really in a great
deal of trouble.

434
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,873
Trouble?

435
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,712
Helping beautiful dames...

436
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,969
uh, uh, damsels in
distress is my specialty.

437
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,381
Now, what's the
hang-up, your ladyship?

438
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,972
Well, it is most important
that I get back to Paris.

439
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,980
So if you would be just so
kind and show me the way...

440
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,314
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.

441
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,228
We shall fly to Paris
on a magic carpet,

442
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:19,493
side by side, with the
stars as our guide.

443
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,073
Just we two.

444
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,910
Oh, that would be wonderful.

445
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,870
Three?

446
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,205
Four?

447
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,870
Five?

448
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,835
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.

449
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,126
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.

450
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,590
Do you really have a magic carpet?

451
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:42,008
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.

452
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,895
Mama, do I have
sparkling sapphire eyes

453
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,772
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?

454
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,025
Yes, right off your cuff.

455
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,028
And you said we're gonna
ride on your magic carpet.

456
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,066
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...

457
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,360
No poetry to cover the
situation, Monsieur O'Malley?

458
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,700
What I had in mind was kind
of a sports model, baby.

459
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,707
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?

460
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,038
Built for two?

461
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,045
I wouldn't take up much room.

462
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,925
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.

463
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,962
Well, come along, darlings.

464
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,767
I'm a tough alley cat, too.

465
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,145
Hey, there.

466
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,682
You're coming on. I bet you're a
real tiger in your neighbourhood.

467
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,068
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.

468
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,730
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.

469
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,648
Yes, Mama.

470
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,567
See you around, tiger.

471
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,829
Now, that's quite a family.

472
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,255
Come to think of it, O'Malley,
you're not a cat. You're a rat.

473
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,963
Right? Right.

474
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,922
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?

475
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,683
Now look, kids,
if I said magic carpet,

476
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,970
magic carpet it's gonna be.

477
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,730
And it's gonna stop
for passengers...

478
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,732
wright...

479
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,481
here.

480
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,860
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.

481
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,196
Another flight into the
fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?

482
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,533
No, no, no, baby.

483
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,952
You just hide over there,

484
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,164
and you leave the rest
to J. Thomas O'Malley.

485
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,207
Quick, Mom, get in here.

486
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,089
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.

487
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,508
One magic carpet, coming up.

488
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,972
That's a magic carpet?

489
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,185
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

490
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:05,034
<i>Sapristi!</i> Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.

491
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,750
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.

492
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,538
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you
could have lost your life.

493
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,547
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.

494
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,756
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.

495
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,427
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.

496
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,764
<i>Bonsoir. Sayonara.</i>

497
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,396
And all those goodbye things, baby.

498
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,103
Sayonara, mister...

499
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,608
Mama!

500
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,769
Marie! Marie!

501
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,825
Oh, Marie, are you all right?

502
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,158
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?

503
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,621
And I'm so very glad we did.

504
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,378
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.

505
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,881
No trouble at all, little princess.

506
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,669
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.

507
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,838
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...

508
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,847
we just couldn't.

509
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:14,182
You see, my mistress will
be so worried about us.

510
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:18,315
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.

511
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,852
Oh, no. You just don't understand.

512
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,271
She loves us very much.

513
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:30,824
Poor Madame, in that
big mansion, all alone.

514
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,370
<i>In all our days, in tender ways,</i>

515
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,794
<i>her love for us was shown.</i>

516
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:46,051
<i>And so you see,
we can't leave her alone.</i>

517
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:55,102
<i>She'd always say that we're the
greatest treasure she could own.</i>

518
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,526
<i>Because with us she
never felt alone.</i>

519
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,319
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.

520
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,734
Did you have any luck at all?

521
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,994
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.

522
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,531
And I've searched all night.

523
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,076
I know. And poor Madame
didn't sleep a wink, either.

524
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,254
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.

525
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,010
Morning, Frou-Frou,
my pretty steed.

526
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,851
Can you keep a secret, hmm?

527
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,637
Of course you can.

528
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,225
I have some news straight
from the horse's mouth,

529
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,735
if you'll pardon the
expression, of course.

530
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:49,569
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.

531
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,406
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."

532
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,866
Aren't you proud of me?

533
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,533
So he's the catnapper.

534
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,327
The police said it was a
professional, masterful job.

535
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,916
The work of a genius.

536
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,548
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?

537
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,221
Oh, they won't find a
clue to implicate me.

538
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,723
Not one single clue.

539
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,725
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...

540
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,136
My hat!

541
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,054
My umbrella!

542
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,814
Oh, oh, gracious.

543
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,566
I've got to get those
things back tonight.

544
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,153
But... oh, you...

545
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,734
Why, that...

546
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,573
sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!

547
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,340
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?

548
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,627
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.

549
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,171
But now we have to
cook up a little spell.

550
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,548
You know. Ready?

551
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,678
All right. First, to make
the magic begin,

552
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,642
you wiggle your nose.

553
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,774
And tickle your chin.

554
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,900
Now you close your eyes.

555
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,443
And cross your heart.

556
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,484
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.

557
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,610
Hooray!

558
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,457
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!

559
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,539
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.

560
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,329
True.

561
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,338
True.

562
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,503
<i>Sapristi!</i>

563
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,175
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

564
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,221
Thieves! Robbers!

565
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,885
Mangy tramps!

566
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,395
Take that and that!

567
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:54,399
Oh. Oh, what a horrible,
horrible human.

568
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,114
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.

569
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,325
I'll show him.

570
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,661
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.

571
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,327
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.

572
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,589
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.

573
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,967
That's a long way off,
so we better get moving.

574
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,596
Gee whiz.

575
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,601
Look at that bridge.

576
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,182
Come on, let's play train.

577
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,268
Now, be careful, children.

578
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,853
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!

579
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,236
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.

580
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,273
Choc choo choo choo...

581
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,610
Clickedy, clickedy,
clickedy, clickedy.

582
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,208
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.

583
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,960
Down underneath here.

584
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,890
- Mama!
- Marie!

585
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,725
Oh, Marie!

586
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,981
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!

587
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,701
Thomas! Thomas, up here.

588
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,890
Gee, Marie, why did you
have to fall off the bridge?

589
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,812
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!

590
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,814
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.

591
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,600
I'll see you downstream.

592
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,201
What beautiful
countryside, Abigail.

593
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,914
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.

594
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,172
Amelia, if I walk much
farther I'll get flat feet.

595
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,801
Abigail, we were
born with flat feet.

596
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,717
I say. Look over there.

597
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,386
Oh. Oh, how unusual.

598
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,556
Fancy that. A cat
learning how to swim.

599
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,724
He's going about it
all the wrong way.

600
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,440
Quite. We must correct him.

601
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,404
Sir. Sir?

602
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,237
You are most fortunate
we happened along.

603
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,401
Yes. We're here to help you.

604
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,289
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.

605
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,247
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.

606
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,208
Go away. I'm trying
to get to shore.

607
00:40:56,371 --> 00:41:00,171
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.

608
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:04,759
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.

609
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,548
Don't do that!

610
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,559
You're doing splendidly.

611
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,222
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.

612
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,893
Oh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?

613
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,188
A very enthusiastic pupil!

614
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,243
No, no. This is no time
for fun and games.

615
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,874
Gracious, Amelia.

616
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,583
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

617
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,043
Bottoms up.

618
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,627
Deeper!

619
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,137
Look, Ma, there he is.

620
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,974
You really did quite
well for a beginner.

621
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:59,397
Oh, Thomas. Thank
goodness you're safe.

622
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,938
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.

623
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,656
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?

624
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:09,490
Help? I've had all
the help I can take.

625
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,998
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.

626
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,497
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.

627
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,833
Yes, we British like to
keep things proper.

628
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:26,003
Now, I am Amelia Gabble
and this is my sister...

629
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,467
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.

630
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,473
You might say we're related.

631
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,181
How nice. I never
would have guessed.

632
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,518
Look, they got rubber feet.

633
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,432
Yeah.

634
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,316
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.

635
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,403
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.

636
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,995
Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.

637
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,703
Yeah, honey, get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.

638
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,038
Now, now, Thomas.

639
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,874
OK, OK, baby.

640
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,789
Hiya, chicks.

641
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,457
How awful.

642
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,006
We're not chickens. We're geese.

643
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:15,052
Nooo. I thought you were swans.

644
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,222
Oh! Oh, flatterer.

645
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,891
Your husband is very
charming and very handsome.

646
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,480
Well...

647
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,738
Uh, you see, I'm not
exactly her husband.

648
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,742
Exactly? You either
are or you're not.

649
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,029
All right. I'm not.

650
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,242
Oh?

651
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,781
Hm.

652
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,542
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.

653
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,828
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.

654
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,543
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.

655
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,754
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.

656
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,420
His chin is very weak, too.

657
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,887
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.

658
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,518
How romantic.

659
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,643
Please, please, let me explain.

660
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,229
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.

661
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,111
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.

662
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,898
Come on, let's get out of here.

663
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,192
Well, girls, see you around.

664
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,532
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.

665
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,791
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?

666
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,122
I think that's a splendid idea.

667
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,128
Oh, no.

668
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,291
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.

669
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,131
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.

670
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,888
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.

671
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,344
And, you dear, you take this place.

672
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,434
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.

673
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,972
We can't leave him, can we?

674
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,318
Mr. O'Malley, I think you
should be the rear end.

675
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,777
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.

676
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,533
Forward march.

677
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:04,123
Mama? Do we have to
waddle like they do?

678
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,583
Yes, dear. Think goose.

679
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,877
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.

680
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,794
Waldo?

681
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,463
Yes, he's our uncle.

682
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,099
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.

683
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:22,433
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's
that famous restaurant.

684
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,768
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

685
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,109
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

686
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,115
Oh, he bit my finger!

687
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,278
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!

688
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,282
Good riddance!

689
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,135
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.

690
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,217
Uncle Waldo!

691
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,257
Abigail! Amelia!

692
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,552
My two favourite nooses.

693
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:07,224
Uncle Waldo, I do believe
you've been drinking.

694
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,065
Oh, dear. What happened to
your lovely tail feathers?

695
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:15,027
Girls, it's outrageous.

696
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,568
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do

697
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,032
to your poor old Uncle Waldo.

698
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,916
Look. Look at this.

699
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,374
"Prime country goose
à la Provençale.

700
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,585
Stuffed with chestnuts"?

701
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,377
And "basted in... white wine".

702
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,095
Basted? He's been marinated in it.

703
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,509
Dreadful.

704
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:46,600
Being British, I would
have preferred sherry.

705
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,442
Sherry! Sherry.

706
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,479
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.

707
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,320
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.

708
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,819
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?

709
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,614
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.

710
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,782
I say, there...

711
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,294
what's all the
whispering about, huh?

712
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,080
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!

713
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,793
Now, now, now, girls.

714
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,460
Girls, don't shush
your old Uncle Waldo.

715
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:21,176
Why, you'll wake up the
whole neighbourhood.

716
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,550
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!

717
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,136
Come along, Uncle Waldo.

718
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,180
Oh, jeez, I think
we'd better be going.

719
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,475
Oh. Right-o, girls.

720
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,018
Birds of a feather must...

721
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,482
together.

722
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,738
That's "stick together".

723
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,818
Oh, stick.

724
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,162
Shush.

725
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,087
You know something?

726
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,498
I like Uncle Waldo.

727
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,793
Especially when he's marinated.

728
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,387
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.

729
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,768
Hurry, Roquefort, hop
aboard the motorcycle.

730
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,055
And for goodness sakes,
do be careful.

731
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,526
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.

732
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,908
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.

733
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,460
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!

734
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,105
I... Whoa!

735
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,036
Lafayette. Lafayette.

736
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,294
Listen.

737
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:00,582
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't
nothin' but a little old cricket bug.

738
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,422
It's squeaky shoes approaching.

739
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,087
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.

740
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,630
Hush your mouth.

741
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,264
Let's see.

742
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,926
They're Oxford shoes.

743
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,936
Size nine and a half.

744
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,518
Hole in the left sole,
it sounds like.

745
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,729
- What colour are they?
- They're black...

746
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,986
Now, how would I know that?

747
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,616
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.

748
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,779
I still say it was a
little old cricket bug.

749
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,916
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.

750
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,665
It was a little old cricket bug.

751
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,455
I'll see ya in the
morning, Napoleon.

752
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,362
That's my hat. I'm the leader.

753
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,952
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.

754
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,708
I ain't done nothin'.

755
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,584
Ooh. Oh.

756
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,212
Ooh.

757
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,771
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.

758
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,273
That's all right.

759
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,275
Mm. Mm.

760
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,686
Mm-mmm.

761
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,604
Oooh.

762
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:32,025
A little lower and faster there.

763
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:35,035
I'm scratching as fast as I can.

764
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,702
Oooh. Right there. That's good.

765
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,834
Oooh.

766
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:16,073
It's so warm... and cosy.

767
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,171
- Oooh.
- Aaah!

768
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,006
Oooh.

769
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,516
What's going on? Lafayette, what
in tarnation you trying to do?

770
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,348
Aw, I get blamed for everything.

771
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,354
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?

772
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:47,687
What? And somebody
stole my bumbershoot.

773
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,319
Where's my beddy-bye basket?

774
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,027
Whoever it is, is gonna
get it and get it good.

775
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,363
This time I get the tender part.

776
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,949
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.

777
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,715
Hey, Napoleon,
it's them shoes again.

778
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,846
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.

779
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,218
Napoleon, I'm plumb
goose-pimply scared.

780
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,354
Now, this is no time
to turn chicken.

781
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,241
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.

782
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,946
Whoo-hoo!

783
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,073
Did you see him?

784
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,084
No, no, he sneaked up
behind me and tailgated me.

785
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,712
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.

786
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,748
Shh. Listen.

787
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,427
Sounds like a one-wheel...

788
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,432
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.

789
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,059
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.

790
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,312
Hey, there it go. Come on.

791
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,097
After it!

792
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,339
I got him, I got him, I got him!

793
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,436
Ow! That's me.

794
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,276
Whoa, whoa. Oh!

795
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,860
Get him, get him.

796
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,861
Ooh. Ow.

797
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:29,168
Well, <i>c'est la guerre</i>, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.

798
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,457
Ow. Oooh, oooh.

799
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,463
Criminently!

800
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,560
But, Thomas, Madame
will be so worried.

801
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,899
Are you sure we can't
get home tonight?

802
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,406
Mama, I'm tired.

803
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,818
Me, too, and my feet hurt.

804
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,452
Look, baby,

805
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,830
it's late and the kids are bushed.

806
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,412
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.

807
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:12,249
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.

808
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,584
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.

809
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,920
Mr. O'Malley knows a place
where we can stay tonight.

810
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,336
How much farther
is it, Mr. O'Malley?

811
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,846
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.

812
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,804
It's just beyond that
next chimney pot.

813
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,271
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.

814
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:35,355
It's not exactly the Ritz,
but it's peaceful and quiet.

815
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,571
Oh! Oh, no.

816
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,530
Sounds like Scat Cat and
his gang have dropped by.

817
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:48,038
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies,

818
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,039
and they're real swingers.

819
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,701
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?

820
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:56,122
You know, not exactly
your type, Duchess.

821
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,882
Maybe we'd better find
another place, huh?

822
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:02,170
Oh, no, no, no. I would
like to see your pad

823
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,713
and meet your Scat Cat.

824
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,472
Well, OK.

825
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:12,555
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of
that sweet stuff my way.

826
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,193
Well, lookie here.

827
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,231
Big man O'Malley's
back in his alley.

828
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,319
Swing on down here, daddy.

829
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,077
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.

830
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,407
Yeah.

831
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,572
<i>Buona sera, paesano.</i>

832
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,207
Welcome home, O'Malley.

833
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:36,291
Duchess, this is the
greatest cat of them all.

834
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,048
Oh, I'm delighted to meet
you, Monsieur Scat Cat.

835
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,880
Likewise, Duchess.

836
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,511
You're too much.

837
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,844
You are charming.

838
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,849
And your music is so...

839
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:54,271
So different, so exciting.

840
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,729
It isn't Beethoven, Mama,
but it sure bounces.

841
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:03,072
Say, this kitten-cat
knows where it's at.

842
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,607
Knows where what's at?

843
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,152

879
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,960
But he was close.

880
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,773
Beautiful.

Happy dreams, my loves.

I'll bet they're on that
magic carpet right now.

913
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,803
They could hardly
keep their eyes open.

914
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,022
Such an exciting day.

915
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,855
It sure was, and what a finale.

916
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,616
Thomas, your friends
are really delightful.

917
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,617
I just love them.

918
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,495
Well, they're kinda rough,
you know, around the edges,

919
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,954
but if you're ever in a jam,
wham, they're right there.

920
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:51,791
And wham, when we needed you,

921
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,047
you were right there.

922
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,049
That was just a lucky
break for me, baby.

923
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,803
Oh, and thank you so much
for offering us your home.

924
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,930
Oh. I mean, your pad.

925
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,138
It's very nice.

926
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,053
Well, now, wait a minute.

927
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,063
This is the low-rent
district, remember?

928
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,145
No, no, no, I like it.

929
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:17,859
Well, all it needs is
a little tidying up,

930
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:22,071
and maybe a little feminine touch.

931
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,077
Well, if you're applying
for the job, well...

932
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,911
Goody. Mother's going to
work for Mr. O'Malley.

933
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:34,622
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.

934
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,795
Gee.

935
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,798
That's pretty corny though, huh?

936
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,134
Oh, no. Not at all.

937
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,174
Any woman would like it.

938
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,844
I-I mean...

939
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,683
even little Marie.

940
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,348
Yeah.

941
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,768
All those little kittens, Duchess.

942
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,027
I love 'em.

943
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,029
And they are very fond of you.

944
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,235
- Yeah.
- Shh.

945
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:05,699
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...

946
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,831
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.

947
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,038
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful.

948
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,007
Darling, if only I could.

949
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,838
But why can't you?

950
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,673
Because of Madame.

951
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,385
I could never leave her.

952
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,551
But... But Madame's...

953
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,469
Well, she's just another human.

954
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,139
You're just her house pets.

955
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,727
Oh, no, no.

956
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,769
We mean far more to her than that.

957
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,906
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

958
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,409
We just have to go home tomorrow.

959
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,445
Yeah.

960
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,831
Well, I guess you know best.

961
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,826
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.

962
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,837
And those kids...

963
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:01,500
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.

964
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,010
Well, we almost had a father.

965
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,388
Yeah.

966
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,594
Let's go back to bed.

967
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,558
Good night, Duchess.

968
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,395
Good night, Thomas.

969
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,465
Hey.

970
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:46,128
Meow!

971
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,262
What a classy neighbourhood.

972
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,641
Dig these fancy wigwams.

973
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,051
Wigwams?

974
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,312
Are you sure we're
on the right street?

975
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,314
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.

976
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:02,774
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

977
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,030
Oh, no. Edgar!

978
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,991
I've got to do something, quick.

979
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,996
Oh, ha.

980
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,329
Edgar, old chap, get used to
the finer things in life.

981
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:20,621
Someday they're all
going to be yours,

982
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,664
you sly old fox.

983
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,500
Oh!

984
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:27,965
Oh, he got me.

985
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,754
Hooray! We're home.

986
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,923
Wait for me, wait for me!

987
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,310
Me first, me first!

988
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,056
- It's locked.
- Come on.

989
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,145
Let's all start meowing.

990
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,355
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.

991
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,359
Uh, why?

992
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,620
Don't come in!

993
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,702
Go away!

994
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,372
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.

995
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,291
Hi, Roquefort!

996
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,084
He's glad to see us.

997
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:12,176
I don't know what to say.

998
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,924
I only wish that I...

999
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:20,188
Maybe just a short, sweet
goodbye would be easiest.

1000
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,647
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.

1001
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,233
Bye.

1002
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,898
So long, baby.

1003
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,739
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!

1004
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,420
Duchess, wherever have you been?

1005
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,331
Look out for the...

1006
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,546
sack.

1007
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:54,556
Well... guess they won't
need me any more.

1008
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:57,763
You came back?

1009
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,887
It just isn't fair.

1010
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,807
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.

1011
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,772
Coming, Madame, coming.

1012
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:10,108
I'll take care of you later.

1013
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,114
Oh, Edgar, they're back.

1014
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:15,777
I heard them. Hurry,
hurry, let them in.

1015
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,911
Duchess? Kittens?

1016
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,625
Come here, my darlings.

1017
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,127
Where are you?

1018
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:27,459
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.

1019
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:33,462
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

1020
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,471
His name is O... what?

1021
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,758
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.

1022
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,052
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...

1023
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:43,017
Oh, never mind. Just run,
move, go get him!

1024
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,977
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.

1025
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,813
I told you it was Edgar.

1026
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,273
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

1027
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,313
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

1028
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,577
I'm afraid it was just the
imagination of an old lady.

1029
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,160
But I was so sure
that I heard them.

1030
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,620
I'm so sorry, Madame.

1031
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,548
Mr. O'Malley!

1032
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,637
Hey, stop!

1033
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,974
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.

1034
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,354
Butler did it.

1035
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,265
Duchess and kittens in trouble?

1036
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:30,606
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

1037
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,691
Alley cats?

1038
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,322
But I'm a mouse.

1039
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,357
Look, I'm gonna need help.

1040
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,367
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!

1041
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,871
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

1042
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,254
No trouble, he said.

1043
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,713
Well, that's easy for...
for what's-his-name to say.

1044
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,379
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.

1045
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:05,057
What's a little swinger like you
doing on our side of town?

1046
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:09,565
Oh, please, I was sent
here for help by a cat.

1047
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,227
This is outrageous. It's crazy.

1048
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,907
But honest! He told me
just to mention his name.

1049
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:25,414
So start mentioning name, rodent.

1050
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,246
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.

1051
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,661
Don't rush me.

1052
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,249
His name is O'Toole.

1053
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,086
I don't dig him. Strike one.

1054
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:37,047
Oh, oh... O'Brien.

1055
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,837
Strike two.

1056
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,596
Oh, boy.

1057
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,429
You believe me... don't you?

1058
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,264
Keep talkin', mousey.

1059
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,724
How about O...

1060
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,605
Grady?

1061
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:50,936
Huh?

1062
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,601
Mousey, you just struck out.

1063
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,772
Any last words?

1064
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,282
Why did I listen to
that O'Malley cat?

1065
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,784
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

1066
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,570
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.

1067
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,283
This little guy's on the level.

1068
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,074
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.

1069
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:11,085
We didn't mean to
ruffle you, squeaky.

1070
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,963
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.

1071
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,123
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.

1072
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,258
Come on, cats, we gotta split.

1073
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,887
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!

1074
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,696
Now, my little pesky pets,

1075
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:48,911
you're going to travel first class.

1076
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,747
In your own private compartment.

1077
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,628
All the way to Timbuktu.

1078
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,917
And this time...
you'll never come back.

1079
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,632
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.

1080
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,673
The baggage truck will
be here any moment now.

1081
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,479
Ooh!

1082
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:33,001
Whoo-hoo. Oww!

1083
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,360
Over there. They're in the trunk.

1084
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,753
Quiet!

1085
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,221
Everybody out of here, fast.

1086
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:34,062
You are going to Timbuktu,

1087
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,690
if it's the last thing I do.

1088
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,135
Well, Mac, this must
be the trunk, eh?

1089
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:10,048
Yup. And she goes all
the way to Timbuktu.

1090
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,804
Heave-ho.

1091
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,585
Now, my pets,
a little closer together.

1092
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,088
Good. Good.

1093
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,840
Look, Georges. What do you think?

1094
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,843
Very good, very good.

1095
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,096
But I think we should
get on with the will.

1096
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:54,009
Yes, yes, of course, but
you know what to do.

1097
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,769
Very well. Scratch one butler.

1098
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:01,182
You know, Georges, if Edgar had
only known about the will,

1099
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,773
I'm sure he never would have left.

1100
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,109
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

1101
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:11,526
And I think this young
man is very handsome.

1102
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,786
Shall we keep him in the family?

1103
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,491
Of course we will.

1104
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,376
We need a man around the house.

1105
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,459
And, Georges, we must
be sure to provide

1106
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,920
for their future little ones.

1107
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,132
Of course. The more the merrier.

1108
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,805
Now, don't move.

1109
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,511
Smile.

1110
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,553
Say "cheese".

1111
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,021
Did somebody say "cheese"?

1112
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,356
Thank you.

1113
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,314
Now, run along downstairs.

1114
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,444
There's a surprise for you.

1115
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,741
Adelaide, what's that music?

1116
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,033
Sounds like a gang
of swinging hepcats.

1117
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,748
That's exactly what
they are, Georges.

1118
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,914
They're the start of
my new foundation.

1119
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,502
What foundation?

1120
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:12,045
My home for all the
alley cats of Paris.

1121
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:19,097

Hey, Napoleon, that
sounds like the end.

1134
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,474
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.

1135
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,642
