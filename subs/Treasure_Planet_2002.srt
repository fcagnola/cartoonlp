00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,136
Is that clear?

356
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,138
Ugh...

357
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,015
Mr. Hawkins?

358
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,394
- Yes, ma'am.
- That'll do.

359
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,980
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key

360
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,483
when not in use. And, Doctor, again,

361
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,360
with the greatest possible respect,

362
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,404
zip your howling screamer.

363
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,655
Captain, I assure you I...

364
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,325
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

365
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,955
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

366
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,999
They're... How did
I describe them, Arrow?

367
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,585
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

368
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,797
"A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots," ma'am.

369
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,342
- There you go. Poetry.
- Now, see here...

370
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:21,513
Doctor, I'd love to chat,
tea, cake, the whole shebang,

371
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,764
but I have a ship to launch,

372
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,850
and you've got your outfit to buff up.

373
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,561
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes

374
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,896
down to the galley straightaway.

375
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,648
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

376
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,650
What? The cook?

377
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,988
That woman! That feline!

378
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,907
Who does she think
is working for whom?

379
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,034
It's my map,
and she's got me bussin' tables?

380
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,871
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

381
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,917

in this or any galaxy.

Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

386
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,595

May I introduce Dr. Doppler,

391
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,067
the financier of our voyage.

392
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,778
Love the outfit, Doc.

393
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,739
Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.

00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,533
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.

These gears have been
tough getting used to,

400
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,518
but they do come in mighty handy
from time to time.

401
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,152
Mmm!

402
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:04,241

In fact, that was part of the old family!

Oh. Ooh.

Oh, don't fuss.

897
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:10,999
Uh... uh...

898
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,918

00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:34,022
Are you serious? It's back on the ship?

906
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,985
Stifle that blob and get low.

907
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,489
We've got company.

908
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:50,372
We need a more defensible position.

909
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,541
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

910
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:55,835
Aye, Captain.

00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:56,962

I just want to hug you and squeeze you

00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:50,598
and hold you close to me.

923
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:53,935
All right. Okay.
Would you just let go of me?

924
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:55,603
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

925
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,441
It's just I've been marooned for so long.

Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?

939
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:33,725
I got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!

I remember Captain Flint.

Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

from mood swings, personally.

when I'm rambling.

But that means... But wait.

948
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,829
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

949
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:56,456
- Treasure?
- Yeah, Flint's trove?

950
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,917

to find a place to hide, okay?

Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search,

would you mind if we made a quick
pit stop at my place? (CHUCKLES)

we still have it.

at least the part concerning you,

1039
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:16,090
I didn't mean a word of it.

1040

had thought I'd gone soft,

1043
01:01:29,771 --> 01:01:34,984
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

Now, just see here, Jimbo...

1052
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:06,974
I mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

1053
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:08,393
Stick to it, right?

1054
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,311
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.

1055
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,230
I'm gonna make sure that you never see

1056
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:14,649
one drabloon of my treasure!

1057
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:18,319
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!

1058
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:22,698
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,829
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

1060
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,415
Now, mark me.

1061

Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,

1062
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:39,173
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons

1063

01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:49,142

1069
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:12,206
And...

1070
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,375
- Ohh.
- And What? What?

1071
01:03:14,459 --> 01:03:16,794
We must stay together and what?

1072
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:22,258
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.

1073
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:24,051
She's lost her mind!

1074
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,344
Well, you gotta help her.

1075
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,972
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

1076
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,849
I mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

1077
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,976
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

1078
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,311
You can't help people with a doctorate.

1079
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:35,897
You just sit there, and you're useless.

1080
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:37,565
It's okay, Doc.

1081
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:39,984
It's all right.

1082
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:43,696
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows
exactly how to get out of this.

1083
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,324
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

1084
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,535
Jim, any thoughts at all?

1085
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,289
Without the map, we're dead.

1086
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:56,751
If we try to leave, we're dead.

1087
01:03:57,752 --> 01:03:59,253
- If we stay here...
-"We're dead!

1088
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,255
"We're dead! We're dead!"

1089
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,514
Well, I think that Jimmy
could use a little quiet time. Heh.

1090
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:12,642
So I'll just slip out the back door.

1091
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,810
- Back door?
- Oh, yeah.

1092
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:17,730
I get this delightful breeze through here,

1093
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:18,940

1094
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:20,525

1095
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:23,152

1096
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:25,029
B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

1097
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,281

of the inside of this planet?

1098
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:28,991
Not a clue.

1099
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,452
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
I found a way out of here!

1100
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,996
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

1101
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,832

(WHISPERING) Okay, here it is.

1106
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:58,062
We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i>
disable the laser cannons,

1107
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,064

1108

01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:05,319
I'm wondering, how do we get there?

- In the flesh!

Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,

1247
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:39,476
or anything that, that...
That resembles flesh,

1248
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,186
that's not there.

1249
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,856
And yet it's so odd, you know?

1250
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,316
I remember
there was something horrible

1251
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,610
Flint didn't want anyone else to know,

1252
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:51,780
but I just can't remember what it was.

Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits,

1264
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:23,687
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

- Huh?

that nobody could ever
steal his treasure,

1269
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:33,739
