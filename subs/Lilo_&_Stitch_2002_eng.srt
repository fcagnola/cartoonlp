2
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:32,001
Read the charges.

3
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:34,561
Dr. Jumba Jookiba...

4
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,802
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defence Industries...

5
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:40,203
you stand before this council

6
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:45,241
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

7
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:52,437
How do you plead?

8
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,205
Not guilty!

9
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:56,920
My experiments
are only theoretical...

10
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,720
completely
within legal boundaries.

11
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:04,079
We believe you actually
created something.

12
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,800
Created something?! Ha!

13
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:09,759
But that would be irresponsible
and unethical.

14
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:13,038
I would never, ever...

15
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,362
...make more than one.

16
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,926
What is that monstrosity?

17
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,480
Monstrosity!

18
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:31,237
What you see before you
is the fiirst of a new species.

19
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:35,121
I call it Experiment 6-2-6.

20
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,996
He is bullet-proof, fiireproof

21
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,720
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

22
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,280
He can see in the dark

23
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,921
and move objects
3,000 times his size.

24
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:48,037
His only instinct:

25
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:51,363
To destroy
everything he touches!

26
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,679
So, it is a monster.

27
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:56,126
Hey, just a little one.

28
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,725
It is an affront to nature.

29
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,359
It must be destroyed!

30
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,238
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.

31
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,676
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

32
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:06,560
Experiment 6-2-6

33
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:09,997
give us some sign you understand
any of this.

34
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,359
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

35
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,640
Hmm?

36
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,042
Meega, nala kweesta!

37
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,239
So naughty!

38
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,079
I didn't teach it that.

39
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:31,561
Place that idiot scientist
under arrest!

40
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:36,442
I prefer to be called
"evil genius"!

41
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:38,717
And as for that abomination...

42
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:42,442
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

43
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,637
It has no place among us.

44
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:47,520
Captain Gantu, take him away.

45
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,206
With pleasure.

46
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,155
Hmm.

47
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:11,002
Uncomfortable?

48
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,002
Oh...

49
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,560
Good!

50
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:17,805
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

51
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,645
So, relax... enjoy the trip

52
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,564
and don't get any ideas.

53
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:26,395
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

54
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:29,280
They won't shoot anyone but you.

55
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,966
Ow! Why, you...!

56
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:35,044
May I remind the captain
that he is on duty.

57
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:38,166
Secure the cell!

58
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:40,038
Aye, Captain.

59
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:45,557
Captain on deck.

60
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,598
All ahead full.

61
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:55,000
Do... Does this, uh,
look infected to you?

62
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh!

63
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:23,441
Quiet, you.

64
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,396
Gunfiire in the cell bay!

65
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:29,436
Open a channel.

66
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,484
He's loose on Deck C!

67
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:41,846
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

68
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,765
Security,
converge on door seven!

69
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,957
Deadly force authorised.

70
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,725
Fire on sight!

71
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,280
There he is!

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,239
Security to Bridge.

73
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:06,438
It's in the ventilation system.

74
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:10,160
He's headed for the power...

75
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:11,196
...grid.

76
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,523
What was that?

77
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,956
I don't think he's
on the ship anymore.

78
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,521
Confiirmed.
He's taken a police cruiser.

79
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,762
Yeah... he took the red one.

80
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:28,238
Yee-haw!

81
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,076
Hmm?!

82
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,526
That's it!

83
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,364
We got it. We got it!

84
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,318
Hyperdrive activated.

85
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,322
System charging.

86
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,244
He's engaged his H-drive!

87
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,676
Warning... guidance
is not functional.

88
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,639
Pursuit Commander, that crazy
trog is about to make ajump!

89
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,042
Break formation!
Get clear of that ship!

90
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,361
Navigation failure.

91
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,046
Do not engage hyper...

92
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:19,160
Get me Galactic Control.

93
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,039
Where is he?!

94
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,315
He's still in hyperspace.

95
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,766
Where will he exit?

96
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:25,876
Calculating now...

97
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,997
quadrant 17, section 0-0-5

98
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,878
area 51.

99
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,805
A planet called... Ee-arth.

100
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:36,476
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

101
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,040
What is that?

102
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,043
Water. Most of the planet
is covered in it.

103
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:41,520
He won't survive in water.

104
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,478
His molecular density
is too great.

105
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,884
No...

106
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,443
Of course.

107
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,079
How much time do we have?

108
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,483
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

109
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:02,960
Oh, we have to gas the planet.

110
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,326
Hold it!

111
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,402
Hold everything!

112
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,041
Earth is a protected
wildlife preserve.

113
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,725
Yeah. We've been using it

114
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,962
to rebuild
the mosquito population

115
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:15,477
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

116
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:18,200
Am I to assume
you are the expert?

117
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:21,842
Oh, I don't know about "expert."

118
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,401
Agent Pleakley at your service.

119
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,085
Can we not simply destroy
the island?

120
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,924
No! Crazyhead!

121
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,800
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life-forms

122
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,485
have colonies
all over that planet.

123
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,677
Are they intelligent?

124
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,240
No, but they're very delicate.

125
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,960
In fact, every time an asteroid
strikes their planet

126
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,282
they have to begin life
all over.

127
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,885
It's fascinating, isn't it?

128
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,043
With this,
I've been able to study...

129
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:47,760
What if our military forces
just landed there?

130
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,320
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

131
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,801
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

132
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,317
Landing there would create mass
mayhem and planet-wide panic!

133
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,086
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 6-2-6

134
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,879
that we do not possess!

135
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:04,364
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would
you send for his extraction?

136
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,001
Does he have a brother?

137
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,844
Close grandmother, perhaps?

138
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,525
Friendly cousin?

139
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,842
Neighbour with a beard?

140
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,522
He got away?

141
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,035
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

142
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,363
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

143
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,444
Which is precisely why you
must now bring him back.

144
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,556
What? Me?

145
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:51,086
And to reward you

146
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:55,996
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

147
00:08:56,047 --> 00:09:00,040
6-2-6 will not come easily.

148
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,555
Maybe direct hit
from plasma cannon

149
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,041
might stun him long enough to...

150
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,076
Plasma cannon granted.

151
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,800
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

152
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,918
B-B-But it's a delicate planet!

153
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,605
Who's going to control him?

154
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,524
You will.

155
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,000
Very good, Your Highness.

156
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:19,197
I... I didn't quite...

157
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,316
Uh, you're notjoking!

158
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:24,406
So, tell me,
my little one-eyed one

159
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:29,157
on what poor, pitiful,
defenceless planet

160
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:35,323
has my monstrosity
been unleashed?

161
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,244

200
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,156
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

201
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,960
Stop. Stop.

202
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:01,682
Lilo, why are you all wet?

203
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,445
It's sandwich day.

204
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,157
Every Thursday,
I take Pudge the fiish

205
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,720
a peanut butter sandwich.

206
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,246
Pudge is a fiish?

207
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,199
And today we were out
of peanut butter!

208
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:17,045
So I asked my sister
what to give him

209
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,317
and she said a tuna sandwich.

210
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,198
I can't give Pudge tuna!

211
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,203
Do you know what tuna is?

212
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:24,202
Fish?

213
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,805
It's fiish!

214
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:29,442
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

215
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,876
I'm late because I had to go
to the store

216
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,076
and get peanut butter

217
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,357
'cause all we have
is-is stinkin' tuna!

218
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:38,604
Lilo, Lilo,
why is this so important?

219
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,603
Pudge controls the weather.

220
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,526
You're crazy.

221
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:48,676
Please! Please!

222
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,719
Everybody calm down!

223
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:52,882
Girls...

224
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,561
Shh.

225
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,801
Lilo...

226
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:57,962
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

227
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,520
I won't do it again!

228
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,762
Maybe we should call
your sister.

229
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,160
No! I'll be good!

230
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,435
I want to dance.

231
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,796
I practised.

232
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,439
ljust want to dance.

233
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,241
I practised.

234
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:14,164
Ooh, she bit me.

235
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,004
Eww!

236
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,725
I called your sister.

237
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,237
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

238
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:30,040
We'll try again on Sunday.

239
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,643
Does this look infected to you?

240
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,756
Yeah.

241
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,201
You better not have rabies.

242
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,760
If you have rabies

243
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,877
the dogcatcher is
going to have to cut...

244
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,838
Are you going to play dolls?

245
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:50,355
You don't have a doll.

246
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,557
This is Scrump.

247
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,803
I made her,
but her head is too big.

248
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:59,237
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset

249
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,881
because she only has
a few more days to...

250
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,084
Lilo!

251
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,118
Lilo?

252
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,320
Lilo?

253
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,198
Oh, no.

254
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,479
You better be home.

255
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,885
Hey! Watch where you're going!

256
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,155
Stupidhead!

257
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,881
I found a new place to dwell...

258
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,282
Oh, Lilo!

259
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,318
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

260
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,005
Go away.

261
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:58,719
You make me so lonely, baby

262
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,120
Lilo?

263
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,885
We don't have time for this.

264
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,155
I get so lonely...

265
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,606
Leave me alone to die.

266
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,966
Come on, Lilo

267
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,963
that social worker's going
to be here any minute!

268
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,317
You still can fiind some room...

269
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:16,557
For broken-hearted lovers
to cry away their gloom

270
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,720
Don't make me so lonely

271
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,166
I get so lonely I could die...

272
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,083
The bellhop's tears
keep flowin'...

273
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,163
You are so fiinished
when I get in there!

274
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,880
Well, they been so long
on Lonely Street

275
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,395
They ain't ever
gonna look back...

276
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:37,199
Oh, I'm going to stuff you
in the blender

277
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,885
push "puree,"
then bake you into a pie

278
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,326
and feed it
to the social worker!

279
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,039
And when he says,
"Mmm, this is great.

280
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,042
What's your secret?"

281
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,043
I'm going to say...

282
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,486
"Love...

283
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,597
and nurturing."

284
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,524
Hi. Uh...

285
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:53,844
You must be the, uh...

286
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,206
The stupidhead.

287
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,124
Oh! Oh...

288
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,237
Oh, you know,
I'm really sorry about that

289
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,404
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

290
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,517
Uh... I can pay for that.

291
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:05,716
It's a rental.

292
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,678
Are you the guardian
in question?

293
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:09,718
Yes. I'm Nani.

294
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,758
Nice to meet you, Mister...?

295
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,445
Bubbles.

296
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,556
Mr. Bubbles.

297
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,801
That's a strange...

298
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:16,916
Yes, I know.

299
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,561
Are you going
to invite me in, Nani?

300
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,565
Uh... I thought we could
sit out here and talk.

301
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,643
I don't think so.

302
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,564
Right. Uh...

303
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,837
And though it's
always crowded...

304
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,206
This way.

305
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,078
You still can fiind some room

306
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:36,120
For broken-hearted lovers
to cry away their gloom

307
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,000
You make me so lonely, baby...

308
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:42,084
Uh... wait here.

309
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,717
Hey!

310
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,120
So...

311
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,203
lemonade?

312
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,283
Do you often
leave your sister home alone?

313
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,397
No. Never.

314
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,439
Well, except forjust now.

315
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,560
Uh, I had to run
to the store to get some...

316
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,438
Oh!

317
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,206
You left the stove on
while you were out?

318
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,202
Low heat!

319
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,202
Just a simmer.

320
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,202
Mmm!

321
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:16,398
It's coming along great.

322
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:17,596
I found that this morning.

323
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,239
Lilo! There you are.

324
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,845
Honeyface...

325
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:23,321
this is Mr. Bubbles.

326
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,801
Nice to meet you.

327
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,680
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

328
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,926
Cobra Bubbles.

329
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,561
You don't look like
a social worker.

330
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:37,757
I'm a special classifiication.

331
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,446
Did you ever kill anyone?

332
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,523
We're getting off the subject.

333
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,795
Let's talk about you.

334
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,599
Are you happy?

335
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,879
I'm adjusted.

336
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:52,246
I eat four food groups

337
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:55,006
and look both ways
before crossing the street

338
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:57,607
and take long naps
and get disciplined.

339
00:17:58,447 --> 00:17:59,402
Disciplined?

340
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,119
Yeah. She disciplines me

341
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,361
real good.

342
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:03,635
Sometimes fiive times a day.

343
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,359
- With bricks.
- No...

344
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,476
Bricks?

345
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,085
Uh-huh, in a pillowcase.

346
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay! That's enough sugar
for you.

347
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:14,476
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie.

348
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,643
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

349
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:17,676
Thirsty?

350
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:23,076
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

351
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,482
in which you have
found yourself.

352
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:30,442
I am the one they call
when things go wrong

353
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:35,003
and things have
indeed gone wrong.

354
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,447
My friends need to be punished.

355
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,159
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

356
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,198
Yep.

357
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:06,957
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

358
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,204
You have three days
to change my mind.

359
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,319
- Blah.
- Eww!

360
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,085
Lilo!

361
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,840
Why didn't you wait
at the school?

362
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,320
You were supposed to wait there!

363
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,800
Lilo!

364
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:56,920
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

365
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,161
Answer me!

366
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,162
No!

367
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,401
No, you don't understand?

368
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:01,402
No!

369
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:02,402
No, what?

370
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,199
No!

371
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:12,915
You're such a pain!

372
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:16,357
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?!

373
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:19,558
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

374
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,279
Go ahead!
Then you'll be happy

375
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,557
because it'll be smarter
than me, too!

376
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,245
And quieter!

377
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,962
You'll like it,
'cause it's stinky, like you!

378
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,918
Go to your room!

379
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:33,162
I'm already in my room!

380
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,206
Hey.

381
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:54,446
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

382
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,559
We're a broken family,
aren't we?

383
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,245
No.

384
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,517
Maybe, a little.

385
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,444
Maybe a lot.

386
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,557
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

387
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:11,883
We're sisters. It's ourjob.

388
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,406
Yeah, well, from now on...

389
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:16,280
I like you better as a sister
than a mom.

390
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,966
Yeah?

391
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:20,725
And you like me better
as a sister

392
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,962
than a rabbit, right?

393
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,281
Oh...

394
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:25,885
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

395
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,720
Yes.

396
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,600
Yes, I do.

397
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:33,842
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

398
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:35,115
You hit her?

399
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,919
Before I bit her.

400
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,400
You bit her.

401
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,926
Lilo, you shouldn't...

402
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:43,118
People treat me different.

403
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,397
They just don't know
what to say.

404
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:46,766
I'll tell you what.

405
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,605
If you promise
not to fiight anymore

406
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:54,277
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

407
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:57,205
Tuesdays and bank holidays
would be good.

408
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:59,761
Yeah? Would that be good?

409
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,640
Oh! My camera's full again.

410
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,247
Aren't they beautiful?

411
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,205
A falling star!

412
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,398
I call it! Get out! Get out!

413
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,960
I have to make a wish!

414
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,362
Can't you go any faster?

415
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,557
Oh, no!
Gravity is increasing on me.

416
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,722
No, it's not!

417
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,120
It is, too, Lilo.

418
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,759
The same thing
happened yesterday.

419
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:37,561
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

420
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,359
Why do you act so weird?!

421
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:44,917
It's me again.

422
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:48,437
I need someone
to be my friend...

423
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:51,399
someone who won't run away.

424
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,166
Maybe send me an angel...

425
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,085
the nicest angel you have.

426
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,799
What we when hit?

427
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:47,406
There it is.

428
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,119
It stay jammed under the fender.

429
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,119
We better call somebody.

430
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,401
We're looking for something
that can defend itself...

431
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,358
something that won't die...

432
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:15,999
something sturdy, you know?

433
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:17,162
Like a lobster.

434
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,435
Lilo, you lolo.

435
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,000
Do we have a lobster door?

436
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,400
No. We have a dog door.

437
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:22,766
We are getting a dog.

438
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,807
So nice to see
your pretty face again!

439
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:32,565
Jumba?

440
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,075
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

441
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,435
The kennel's back this way.

442
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:42,126
Go. Pick someone out.

443
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,878
Hello?

444
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,035
Hello?!

445
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,645
Are there any "aminals" in here?

446
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:02,126
Hello!

447
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:12,802
Hi.

448
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,724
Hoh... ha...

449
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:16,598
Hi...

450
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:19,326
Wow!

451
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,356
Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.

452
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:22,125
All of our dogs are adoptable.

453
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,919
Except that one!

454
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,798
What is that thing?!

455
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:27,075
A dog, I think.

456
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,560
But it was dead this morning.

457
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:30,040
It was dead this morning?!

458
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,840
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

459
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:35,196
I like him! Come here, boy.

460
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:40,205
Oh! Aah!

461
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,999
Wouldn't you like
a different dog?

462
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:44,197
We have better dogs, dear.

463
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:45,805
Not better than him.

464
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,678
He can talk! Say hello.

465
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:48,921
He... Hel...

466
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,923
Dogs can't talk, dear.

467
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,036
He did.

468
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,681
Does it have to be this dog?

469
00:25:58,687 --> 00:25:59,722
Yes, he's good.

470
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,086
I can tell.

471
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,004
You'll have to think of a name
for him.

472
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,039
His name is... Stitch.

473
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:07,520
Now, that's not a real name...

474
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,636
Hmm. Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.

475
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,086
...in Iceland...

476
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:11,845
but here, it's a good name.

477
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,286
Stitch it is.

478
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,045
And there's
a two-dollar license fee.

479
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:16,600
I want to buy him!

480
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:18,877
Can I borrow two dollars?

481
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,084
He's all yours.

482
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,719
You're all mine.

483
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,997
Well, what's he doing?

484
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,480
Shh! Keep quiet.

485
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,040
He's listening for us.

486
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,838
How good is his hearing?

487
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,605
I mean, can he...?

488
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,923
Why don't you run?

489
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,766
Coming! I'm coming!

490
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,035
Stop!

491
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:54,203
I havejust determined
this situation

492
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,646
to be far too hazardous!

493
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,757
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

494
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:01,595
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

495
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:04,764
Here! Educate yourself.

496
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:07,037
Using a little girl
for a shield.

497
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,964
This is low, even for you!

498
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,998
Whoo-hoo!

499
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,082
Bah!

500
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,082
Tear him apart

501
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:14,845
with all both my bare hands!

502
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:15,956
Have you lost your mind?!

503
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,235
What is it, Stitch?

504
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,437
We cannot be seen!

505
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:23,442
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

506
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,082
You can't shoot,
and you can't be seen.

507
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:28,560
Look at you!

508
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,598
You look like a monster.

509
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,239
We have to blend in.

510
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,796
Okay, I got to get to work.

511
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,236
Stick around town and stay
out of the roads, okay?

512
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,322
I'll meet you at 1:00.

513
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,039
Hmm?

514
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:41,042
Oh!

515
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,076
Ah!

516
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay, I guess
we should be going.

517
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:53,404
What about Stitch?

518
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:00,882
My friends!

519
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,684
What do you want?

520
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,046
I'm sorry I bit you

521
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,440
and pulled your hair

522
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,478
and punched you in the face.

523
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,279
Apology not accepted.

524
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:17,081
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

525
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:19,516
I got a new dog.
His name is Stitch.

526
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:23,082
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

527
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,243
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,561
Eww! Get it away from me!

529
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:27,926
I'm gonna get a disease!

530
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:34,565
Somebody do something!

531
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:35,881
Oh, great! He's loose.

532
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,600
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

533
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,286
He will be irresistibly drawn
to large cities

534
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:42,999
where he will back up sewers

535
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:46,198
reverse street signs
and steal everyone's left shoe.

536
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,799
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

537
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:13,200
Are you okay?

538
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,039
Doo-doo, doo-doo

539
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:23,318
You can shake an apple
off an apple tree

540
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:27,121
Shake-a, shake-a, sugar,
but you'll never shake me

541
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,805
- Uh-uh-uh
- Doo-doo-doo

542
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,599
No, siree, uh-uh...

543
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:31,841
Uh-uh.

544
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,081
...Doo-doo-doo

545
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:34,879
Doo-doo-doo

546
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,519
I'm gonna stick like glue

547
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,797
Stick because I'm...

548
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:41,156
Stuck on you

549
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,435
I'm gonna run my fiingers

550
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:45,638
Through your long, black hair...

551
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:47,006
Hey, over here, little buddy.

552
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,844
Squeeze you tighter
than a grizzly bear

553
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,206
- Uh-uh-uh
- Doo-doo-doo

554
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,805
Yes, siree, uh-huh

555
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,361
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

556
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:57,080
I'm gonna stick like glue

557
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,516
Stick because I'm...

558
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,762
Stuck on you

559
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:04,082
Hide in the kitchen

560
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:06,197
Hide in the hall

561
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:08,966
Ain't gonna do you no good
at all

562
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,238
'Cause once I catch ya
and the kissin' starts

563
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:15,836
A team o' wild horses
couldn't tear us apart

564
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:19,436
Try to take a tiger
from his daddy's side...

565
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,675
When you're ready to give up,
just let us know, heh?

566
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:25,682
Whee!

567
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:27,479
Uh-uh-uh...

568
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:32,118
Yeah!

569
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,123
This is you.

570
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,557
This is your badness level.

571
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,122
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

572
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,839
We have to fiix that.

573
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,206
Ay-yi-yi, Lilo!

574
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,078
Your dog cannot sit
at the table.

575
00:31:16,127 --> 00:31:19,164
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.

576
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,277
Oh, you didn't even eat
your sweet potato.

577
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:22,601
I thought you liked them.

578
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,841
Desserts!

579
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,798
David!

580
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,599
I got a new dog.

581
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,478
Oh! You sure it's a dog?

582
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,846
Uh-huh.

583
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:38,038
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

584
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,759
Yum!

585
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,806
Hey...

586
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,565
Blah!

587
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:50,475
Eww!

588
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:52,199
Howzit, Nani?

589
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,478
Did you catch fiire again?

590
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:56,880
Nah, just the stage.

591
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,519
Listen, I was wondering

592
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,035
if you're not doing anything
this...

593
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,045
David, I told you, I can't. I...

594
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:07,564
I got a lot to deal
with right now.

595
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,405
I know. Ljust fiigured
you might need some time...

596
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:11,960
You smell like a lawn mower.

597
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,595
Look, I got to go.

598
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:17,639
The kid at table three's
throwing poi again.

599
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,598
Maybe some other time, okay?

600
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:20,875
Don't worry.

601
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:23,487
She likes your butt
and fancy hair.

602
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,404
I know. I read her diary.

603
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,960
She thinks it's fancy?

604
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,279
Blech!

605
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,481
Oh! Mmm!

606
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,324
Aha! Look what I fiind!

607
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,880
Get restraints!

608
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,280
Right.

609
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,443
Ow! Take that! Hurry!

610
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:50,001
Uh, hold stilljust a...

611
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:52,916
Aah!

612
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,281
Hey, Nani!

613
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,396
Is that your dog?

614
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:08,721
Uh...

615
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:10,803
All is well.

616
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,678
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

617
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:15,400
Oh, your head looks swollen.

618
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,403
Actually, she'sjust ugly.

619
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:19,483
Darling...

620
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:20,801
He'sjoking.

621
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,246
Ugly... look at me...

622
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,243
Uh, this is not working out.

623
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,686
Uh, b-but...

624
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:26,762
Mm-mm.

625
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,923
Yeah?

626
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,435
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid...

627
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:33,478
fakey luau anyway.

628
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:35,563
Come on, Lilo.

629
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:43,195
Did you lose yourjob
because of Stitch and me?

630
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:45,363
Nah. The manager's a vampire

631
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,763
and he wanted me tojoin
his legion of the undead.

632
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:52,083
I knew it.

633
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:53,526
This is a great home.

634
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,080
You'll like it a lot.

635
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:57,362
See?

636
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:59,045
Uh, Lilo...

637
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,076
Comfy.

638
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:02,596
- Hey!
- Hey!

639
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:04,239
What is the matter with you?

640
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,039
Be careful of the little angel!

641
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,440
It's not an angel, Lilo.

642
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,205
I don't even think it's a dog.

643
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,965
Wejust have to take him back.

644
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,396
He'sjust cranky
because it's his bedtime.

645
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:15,005
He's creepy, Lilo.

646
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,277
I won't sleep while he's loose
in the house.

647
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:19,522
You're loose in the house
all the time

648
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:20,761
and I sleepjust fiine!

649
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,081
Hey, what are you doing?

650
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,357
Stop that, Stitch!

651
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:25,886
Hey!

652
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,926
Look at him, Lilo.

653
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,117
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

654
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,441
We have to take him back.

655
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,318
He was an orphan
and we adopted him!

656
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,358
What about "O'hana"?

657
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:39,159
He hasn't been here that long.

658
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:43,166
Neither have I.
Dad said O'hana means family.

659
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:46,881
Huh?

660
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:48,519
O'hana means family.

661
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,841
Family means...

662
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,764
...nobody gets left behind.

663
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:53,035
Or...?

664
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:54,281
Or forgotten.

665
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:55,601
I know. I know.

666
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,559
I hate it
when you use O'hana against me.

667
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,035
Mmm.

668
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:05,363
Don't worry, you can sleep
right next to me.

669
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,524
Look how curious
the puppy is.

670
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:17,526
This is my room,
and this is your bed.

671
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,035
This is your dolly
and bottle.

672
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:21,679
See? Doesn't spill.

673
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,763
I fiilled it with coffee.

674
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,162
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

675
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:28,722
Hey!

676
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,076
That's mine!

677
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,206
Down!

678
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:37,086
Mmm!

679
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,446
Be careful of that!

680
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:40,000
You don't touch this!

681
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,038
Don't ever touch it!

682
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,398
No! Don't pull on her head!

683
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,563
She's recovering from surgery.

684
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:56,444
No! That's from my blue period.

685
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,645
Mmm...

686
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,166
There.

687
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:06,675
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

688
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:09,366
Why not try and make
something for a change?

689
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,805
Ah!

690
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,485
Wow. San Francisco.

691
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,680
Save me!

692
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:43,080
Eek!

693
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:45,436
No more caffeine for you.

694
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:50,321
This little girl is wasting
her time.

695
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:54,121
6-2-6 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

696
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,001
Ooh!

697
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:00,596
Push that over.

698
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:01,841
What are you doing?

699
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,956
Nothing!

700
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,725
Uh, say, I want to try it on.

701
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,166
No!

702
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,435
Share! Let me try it!

703
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:10,206
Hey! Ow! You'rejustjealous
'cause I'm pretty!

704
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:11,475
Don't move.

705
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,678
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

706
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:17,560
She's so beautiful.

707
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:18,881
Look, another one.

708
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:21,964
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

709
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,281
And they like me!

710
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,683
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

711
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:29,287
Now they're, um, they're...

712
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,438
I think it might be a koala.

713
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,636
An evil koala.

714
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,881
I can't even pet it.

715
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:41,078
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

716
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:45,557
Hello?

717
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,518
Nani?

718
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:51,317
Hello?

719
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,881
Are you there?

720
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,764
Now, this is interesting.

721
00:37:58,807 --> 00:37:59,762
What?

722
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,685
6-2-6 was designed
to be a monster

723
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,844
but now he has nothing
to destroy.

724
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:09,926
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

725
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:14,085
What must it be like
to have nothing...

726
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:19,804
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

727
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,635
Nah!

728
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:33,606
Hmm.

729
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:36,601
Hmm...

730
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:51,759
That's the Ugly Duckling.

731
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,640
See? He's sad
because he's all alone

732
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:56,325
and nobody wants him

733
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,279
but on this page,
his family hears him crying

734
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:00,726
and they fiind him.

735
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,837
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy

736
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,242
because he knows
where he belongs.

737
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,245
Hmm...

738
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,720
Want to listen to the King?

739
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,804
You look like an Elvis fan.

740
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:25,099
Nani.

741
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,945
Nani!

742
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:28,546
Uh... yeah?

743
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:30,340
Look.

744
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:38,137
We can't go on together

745
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:40,656
With suspicious minds...

746
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,983
Suspicious minds...

747
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:45,906
We can build our dreams...

748
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,063
On suspicious minds...

749
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,226
Heard you lost yourjob.

750
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,577
Well, uh, actually,
ljust quit thatjob

751
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,620
because, you know,
the hours arejust not conducive

752
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:01,977
to the challenges
of raising a child...

753
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,541
Hey!

754
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:05,897
I am so sorry about that.

755
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,700
What is that thing?

756
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,067
That's my puppy.

757
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:12,066
Really?

758
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,944
Thus far, you have been adrift

759
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:18,707
in the sheltered harbour
of my patience

760
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,387
but I cannot ignore
you beingjobless.

761
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,498
Do I make myself clear?

762
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,425
Perfectly.

763
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:27,424
And next time I see this dog

764
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,665
I expect it to be
a model citizen... capisce?

765
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,142
Uh... yes?

766
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:34,223
Newjob.

767
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,782
Model citizen.

768
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,666
Good day.

769
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,057
You look like an angel...

770
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,143
Mrs. Hasagawa?

771
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:47,907
I'm here to answer
your newspaper ad.

772
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,859
Elvis Presley was
a model citizen.

773
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,102
Walk like an angel...

774
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,104
I've compiled a list
of his traits

775
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,297
for you to practise.

776
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:55,986
Number one is dancing.

777
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,507
I can't talk now, dear.

778
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,062
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

779
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,382
That's why I'm here.

780
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:02,622
Hands on your hips.

781
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,499
Now follow my lead.

782
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:08,227
Ooh-hoo.

783
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:10,145
You fooled me
with your kisses...

784
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:11,701
Ah! That's my want ad.

785
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:13,579
I know!

786
00:41:13,628 --> 00:41:16,859
Heaven knows how you lied to me

787
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,421
You're not the way...

788
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:20,698
Whoa, whoa!

789
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:23,546
Why is everything so dark?

790
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,624
I am all about coffee.

791
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:26,942
Let's move on to step two.

792
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,057
Walk like an angel...

793
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:29,427
Elvis played guitar. Here.

794
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:30,617
Talk like an angel...

795
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:35,378
Hold it like this,
and put your fiingers here.

796
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,066
See? Now you try.

797
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:41,576
...and I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

798
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:43,744
I wish I could, Nani,
but ljust hired Teddy

799
00:41:43,788 --> 00:41:45,426
and with tourist season
ending...

800
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:59,057
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

801
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:00,382
You look like an angel...

802
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:01,986
ljust love to answer phones...

803
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,507
This is the face of romance.

804
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:04,663
Walk like an angel...

805
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,825
She looks like
she could use some lovin'.

806
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:11,577
Talk like an angel,
but I got wise...

807
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,346
Oh, we might have something.

808
00:42:13,388 --> 00:42:14,980
Good. Now kiss her.

809
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,107
The devil in disguise...

810
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:21,140
I'm sure Elvis had
his bad days, too.

811
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:22,303
I'm all about saving people?

812
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:23,667
I thought
that I was in heaven...

813
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,027
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

814
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:26,023
Really?

815
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:27,023
Okay, this is it.

816
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:28,183
But I was sure surprised...

817
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:29,547
Time to bring it all together.

818
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,816
Oh, that'd be so great!

819
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:33,177
You have no idea
how badly I need thisjob.

820
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:35,139
The devil in your eyes

821
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,701
You're the devil in disguise...

822
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:37,703
It's all you!

823
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:38,863
Knock 'em dead!

824
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:42,866
The devil in disguise

825
00:42:57,948 --> 00:43:00,416
You're the devil in disguise...

826
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:01,423
Don't crowd him!

827
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:02,423
Oh, yes, you are

828
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:04,106
The devil in disguise...

829
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,267
The devil in disguise,
oh, yes...

830
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:09,297
Hey, knock it off!

831
00:43:46,068 --> 00:43:47,786
Hey, Lilo!

832
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:50,422
Howzit... Nani?

833
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:52,857
We've been having a bad day.

834
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,459
Hmm...

835
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:00,419
Hey, I might not be a doctor

836
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:03,141
but I know
that there's no better cure

837
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:05,907
for a sour face
than a couple of boards

838
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:07,506
and some choice waves.

839
00:44:07,548 --> 00:44:09,857
What you think?

840
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:12,980
I think that's a great idea.

841
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:16,026
- Aloha e, aloha e
- Aloha e, aloha e

842
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:19,265
- 'Ano'ai ke aloha e
- 'Ano'ai ke aloha e

843
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:22,664
- Aloha e, aloha e
- Aloha e, aloha e

844
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,380
'Ano'ai ke aloha e

845
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,578
'Ano'ai ke aloha e...

846
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,386
There's no place I'd rather be

847
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:40,180
Than on my surfboard out at sea

848
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:42,537
Lingering in the ocean blue

849
00:44:42,588 --> 00:44:44,783
And if I had one wish come true

850
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:48,616
I'd surf till the sun sets
beyond the horizon

851

There's no place I'd rather be

Than on a seashore dry, wet free

864
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:22,819
On golden sand is where I'd lay

865
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,745
And if I only had my way

866
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,747

Hang loose, hang ten,

Coastin' with
the motion of the ocean

876
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:54,699
Whirlpools swirling,
cascading, twirling

877
00:45:54,748 --> 00:45:57,103
Hawaiian roller coaster ride...

878
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,496
Oh, can't complain, Mom.

879
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:11,698
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal

880
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:14,057
and, uh... oh, I had my head
chewed on by a monster!

881
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,097
Wait...

882
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,218
something is not right.

883
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:20,658
6-2-6 is returning
willingly to water.

884
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,346
Oh, hold on, Mom... another call.

885
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,897
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.

886
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:27,222
I want a status report.

887
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:28,621
Oh, uh, things are going well.

888
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:29,623
He cannot swim!

889
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:30,783
Things are going well.

890
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:32,307
Jumba, aren't they going well?

891
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:33,781
Why will he risk drowning?

892
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:35,022
Jumba?

893
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,740
Jumba, help me out here.

894
00:46:36,788 --> 00:46:40,224
I would have expected you back
by now, with 6-2-6 in hand.

895
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:43,499
Just a few things left to pack
and, uh, we'll be...

896
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:45,743
Hang up.

897
00:46:45,788 --> 00:46:46,903
We are going swimming.

898
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:49,178
Huh?

899
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:51,025
There's no place I'd rather be

00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:40,901
Oh... some lolo
must have stuffed us

919
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,176
in the barrel.

920
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:43,627
Where's Stitch?

921
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:46,977
Get off of her!

922
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:49,701
What happened?

923
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:51,898
Stitch dragged her down.

924
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:01,144
We lost Stitch!

925
00:48:25,788 --> 00:48:28,507
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.

926
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:30,106
Look at me, baby. Are you hurt?

927
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:32,139
No.

928
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:39,417
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

929
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:54,502
David, take Lilo.

930
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:56,504
This isn't what it looks like.

931
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:57,583
We were...

932
00:48:57,628 --> 00:49:00,062
It-It'sjust that...

933
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,939
I know you're trying, Nani

934
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:08,663
but you need to think
about what's best for Lilo...

935
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:12,303
even if it removes you
from the picture.

936
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,946
I'll be back tomorrow morning
for Lilo.

937
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:21,865
I'm sorry.

938
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:31,657
Nani?
Is there something I can do?

939
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:32,902
No, David.

940
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:36,941
Uh, I need
to take Lilo home now.

941
00:49:36,988 --> 00:49:40,424
We have a lot to talk about,
Lilo.

942
00:49:40,468 --> 00:49:43,380
Thanks.

943
00:49:45,908 --> 00:49:50,857
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

944
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,537
Then you came along.

945
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,026
Lilo, honey...

946
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:24,822
we have to, uh...

947
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:27,616
Don't worry.

948
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:30,466
You're nice, and someone
will give you ajob.

949
00:50:30,508 --> 00:50:33,022
I would.

950
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:37,341
Come here.

951
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:52,780
Aloha Oe, Aloha Oe

952
00:50:52,828 --> 00:51:01,861
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo

953
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:11,306
One fond embrace, a ho'i a'e au

954
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:20,017
Until we meet again.

955
00:51:37,788 --> 00:51:40,541
That's us before...

956
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:44,467
It was rainy,
and they went for a drive.

957
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:49,104
What happened to yours?

958
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,787
I hear you cry at night.

959
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:53,500
Do you dream about them?

960
00:51:56,548 --> 00:51:58,698
I know that's why
you wreck things

961
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,659
and push me.

962
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:10,299
Our family's little now
and we don't have many toys

963
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:14,421
but if you want,
you could be part of it.

964
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:19,144
You could be our baby
and we'd raise you to be good.

965
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:24,499
"O'hana" means family.

966
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:29,338
"Family" means
nobody gets left behind

967
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:33,700
but if you want to leave,
you can.

968
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:43,226
I'll remember you, though.

969
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:46,624
I remember everyone that leaves.

970
00:53:14,308 --> 00:53:16,663
L... L...

971
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:19,017
Lost.

972
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:28,826
I'm lost.

973
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:35,499
Help!

974
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:37,618
I don't like the ocean!

975
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:42,144
Oh, look,
a friendly little dolphin.

976
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:44,144
They helped sailors
in the war...

977
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:45,906
It's a shark!

978
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:47,666
It's a shark,
and it ain't friendly!

979
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,777
It looks like a dolphin.

980
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:49,863
Tricky fiish! Tricky fiish!

981
00:53:49,908 --> 00:53:51,182
Oh, octopus, come and help me?

982
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,061
An octo... octopus is worse
than a shark!

983
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:55,621
I hate this planet!

984
00:54:00,828 --> 00:54:02,784
Oh...

985
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:05,979
little monster!

986
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,416
Uh, Agent Pleakley here.

987
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,823
I have lost patience
with you both.

988
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:20,019
Have you captured 6-2-6
or not?

989
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:21,023
Um...

990
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:22,626
Uh, uh...

991
00:54:22,668 --> 00:54:24,704
Consider yourselves fiired
and prison-bound.

992
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:28,377
Your incompetence is nothing
short of unspeakable!

993
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:30,578
But, uh... mm...

994
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:34,583
We're fiired!

995
00:54:34,628 --> 00:54:36,983
Now we do it my way!

996
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:39,144
Your way?

997
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:40,667
Oh... uh, wait!

998
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:43,222
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

999
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:45,463
Uh, Jumba and Pleakley.

1000
00:54:45,508 --> 00:54:48,181
Whatever.
The mission is injeopardy.

1001
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:52,938
This could be your chance to
redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

1002
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:56,025
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

1003
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:58,946
Immediately.

1004
00:55:12,668 --> 00:55:13,623
Don't run.

1005
00:55:13,668 --> 00:55:15,420
Don't make me shoot you.

1006
00:55:15,468 --> 00:55:18,346
You were expensive.

1007
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:20,106
Yes. Yes, that's it.

1008
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,616
Come quietly.

1009
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:24,420
Mm... waiting.

1010
00:55:24,468 --> 00:55:26,459
For what?

1011
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:30,338
Family.

1012
00:55:30,388 --> 00:55:32,583
Ah!

1013
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:34,505
You don't have one.

1014
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:37,016
I made you.

1015
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:40,299
Oh... maybe I could...

1016
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:42,304
You're built to destroy.

1017
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:46,580
You can never belong.

1018
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:49,142
Now come quietly
and we will take you apart.

1019
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:51,099
No, no, no, no,
don't, don't run!

1020
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,218
Don't run!

1021
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:09,184
Lilo.

1022
00:56:09,228 --> 00:56:10,946
I didn't hear you get up.

1023
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:14,826
Baby, what's wrong?

1024
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:16,506
Stitch left.

1025
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:17,822
Really?

1026
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:20,063
It's good he's gone.

1027
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:23,418
He didn't want to be here,
anyway.

1028
00:56:23,468 --> 00:56:24,947
We don't need him.

1029
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:30,104
Lilo...

1030
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:32,821
sometimes you try your hardest

1031
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:37,464
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

1032
00:56:37,508 --> 00:56:40,306
Sometimes things have to change

1033
00:56:40,348 --> 00:56:44,500
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better...

1034
00:56:44,548 --> 00:56:47,381
even if...

1035
00:56:47,428 --> 00:56:50,386
Nani!

1036
00:56:50,428 --> 00:56:52,180
David!

1037
00:56:52,228 --> 00:56:53,627
I think I found you ajob.

1038
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:54,817
You what?!

1039
00:56:54,868 --> 00:56:56,187
Old man Kukhkini's store

1040
00:56:56,228 --> 00:56:57,343
but we got to hurry.

1041
00:56:57,388 --> 00:57:00,107
Oh, um, okay. Lilo?

1042
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:01,627
Baby, this is really important.

1043
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,704
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

1044
00:57:03,748 --> 00:57:05,022
I'm going to be right back.

1045
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:06,342
Lock the door

1046
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:08,299
and don't answer it
for anyone, okay?

1047
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:12,779
Things are fiinally
turning around.

1048
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:14,864
Aw, David, I owe you one.

1049
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:16,341
That's okay.

1050
00:57:16,388 --> 00:57:18,902
You canjust date me,
and we'll call it even.

1051
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:26,744
Come back here, you little...!

1052
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:31,506
Stitch?

1053
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,617
What is it?

1054
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:33,862
Shh!

1055
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:37,578
Oh, hiding
behind your little friend

1056
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:39,186
won't work anymore.

1057
00:57:39,228 --> 00:57:40,707
Didn't I tell you?

1058
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,943
We got fiired this morning.

1059
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:45,024
New rules.

1060
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:46,740
Ha!

1061
00:57:46,788 --> 00:57:47,777
Ooh.

1062
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:50,506
Oh, ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1063
00:57:52,028 --> 00:57:53,984
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog...

1064
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:55,302
What are we going to do?

1065
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:56,622
Cryin' all the time...

1066
00:57:56,668 --> 00:57:57,783
Ooh! I love this song!

1067
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,784
Pliers.

1068
00:57:59,828 --> 00:58:00,783
Screwdriver.

1069
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:01,783
Check.

1070
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:02,817
Come out, my friend

1071
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:04,381
from whomever
you're hiding behind.

1072
00:58:04,428 --> 00:58:06,100
Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit

1073
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:07,740
And you ain't no friend
of mine...

1074
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,062
What the...?

1075
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,178
Ooh!

1076
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:14,864
Come on!
What's the big deal?

1077
00:58:16,268 --> 00:58:18,623
I'll put you
back together again.

1078
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:21,307
I'll make you taller
and not so fluffy!

1079
00:58:21,348 --> 00:58:23,179
I like fluffy!

1080
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:24,741
No... No...

1081
00:58:24,788 --> 00:58:26,346
No!

1082
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:32,180
Oh, leave my mother out of this!

1083
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:34,219
You could do with a makeover.

1084
00:58:34,268 --> 00:58:36,543
I tried
to give you my good looks

1085
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:39,341
but let's face it,
something went wrong.

1086
00:58:39,388 --> 00:58:40,423
No!

1087
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:45,423
Quick! Follow me!

1088
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:46,423
If we make it to...

1089
00:58:46,468 --> 00:58:47,423
You're alive!

1090
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:49,823
They're all over the place!

1091
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:51,745
Running away? Here...

1092
00:58:51,788 --> 00:58:53,187
let me stop you.

1093
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,304
You always get in way!

1094
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,303
Where's the girl?

1095
00:58:58,348 --> 00:58:59,701
What have you done to the girl?

1096
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:00,897
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?

1097
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:03,178
Aliens are attacking my house.

1098
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:05,867
No, no, no! No aliens!

1099
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:10,259
Blue punch buggy!

1100
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,943
No punch back.

1101
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:15,057
They want my dog!

1102
00:59:15,108 --> 00:59:16,780
There's no need
to alert the authorities.

1103
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:17,943
Everything's under control.

1104
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:19,899
Lilo, who was that?

1105
00:59:19,948 --> 00:59:21,859
Oh, good,
my dog found the chain saw.

1106
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,023
Lilo! Don't hang...!

1107
00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:32,220
Ha!

1108
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,383
You shouldn't play with guns.

1109
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:34,383
Oh, okay.

1110
00:59:34,428 --> 00:59:36,658
Thank you.

1111
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,221
Oh, ljust remembered.
It's your birthday!

1112
00:59:38,268 --> 00:59:39,223
Happy birthday!

1113
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:40,223
Merry Christmas!

1114
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:41,223
It's not Christmas.

1115
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:42,223
Happy Hanukkah!

1116
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:43,223
We're leaving Stitch?

1117
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:44,223
Trust me.

1118
00:59:44,268 --> 00:59:45,462
This is not going to end well.

1119
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:46,861
- One potato.
- Two potato.

1120
00:59:46,908 --> 00:59:48,182
- Three potato.
- Four.

1121
00:59:48,228 --> 00:59:49,581
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

1122
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,027
Seven potato, more.

1123
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:53,866
My... mother... told... me...
you... are... it.

1124
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:55,136
Oh, I win!

1125
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:04,021
Thanks. Mahalo plenty.

1126
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,057
You won't be disappointed.

1127
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:06,143
I'll show up early to help

1128
01:00:06,188 --> 01:00:07,337
with the morning deliver...

1129
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:12,625
Oh, don't turn left.

1130
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:16,621
No.

1131
01:00:21,308 --> 01:00:24,664
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

1132
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,141
Oh, Lilo!

1133
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,304
Please... don't do this.

1134
01:00:30,348 --> 01:00:32,145
You know I have no choice.

1135
01:00:32,188 --> 01:00:34,065
No! You're not taking her!

1136
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:36,019
I'm the only one
who understands her!

1137
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:37,899
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

1138
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:39,904
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

1139
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:42,018
You don't know what you're
doing! She needs me!

1140
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:44,138
Is this what she needs?!

1141
01:00:44,188 --> 01:00:47,180
It seems clear to me
that you need her

1142
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:49,742
a lot more than she needs you.

1143
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,187
Lilo! Lilo!

1144
01:00:56,228 --> 01:00:59,345
- Lilo!
- Lilo!

1145
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:00,867
Lilo!

1146
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:10,424
- Lilo!
- Lilo!

1147
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:21,059
You ruined everything.

1148
01:01:27,868 --> 01:01:30,541
You're one of them?

1149
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:32,497
Ooh!

1150
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:34,220
Get out of here, Stitch.

1151
01:01:37,308 --> 01:01:39,185
Surprise!

1152
01:01:40,548 --> 01:01:43,540
And here I thought you'd be
diffiicult to catch.

1153
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:46,739
Ho-ho-ho. Silly me.

1154
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:48,983
Lilo?

1155
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:51,064
Lilo!

1156
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:04,666
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

1157
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:09,942
And look... I even caught you
a little snack.

1158
01:02:14,788 --> 01:02:17,461
No! Stop!

1159
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:28,626
Lilo.

1160
01:02:30,548 --> 01:02:31,776
Aah!

1161
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:33,056
Okay, talk.

1162
01:02:33,108 --> 01:02:34,860
I know you had something
to do with this.

1163
01:02:34,908 --> 01:02:36,023
Now where is Lilo?

1164
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:38,741
Talk! I know you can.

1165
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,577
Okay, okay.

1166
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:48,061
Where's Lilo?

1167
01:02:48,108 --> 01:02:49,826
Lilo...

1168
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:54,466
Now all your washing is up!

1169
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:55,736
You're under arrest!

1170
01:02:55,788 --> 01:02:56,937
Read him his rights.

1171
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:58,944
Listen carefully.

1172
01:03:01,588 --> 01:03:03,067
Hello? Galactic Command?

1173
01:03:03,108 --> 01:03:05,702
Experiment 6-2-6 is in custody.

1174
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,625
We'll wait right here.

1175
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:16,217
Huh?

1176
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:19,101
Don't interact with her.

1177
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:23,941
Where's Lilo?

1178
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:24,943
Who?

1179
01:03:24,988 --> 01:03:26,057
What?!

1180
01:03:28,188 --> 01:03:31,021
Lilo... my sister.

1181
01:03:32,788 --> 01:03:35,541
Uh, sorry, we do not know

1182
01:03:35,588 --> 01:03:38,022
anyone by this, uh...

1183
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:39,865
Lilo! She's a little girl...
this big!

1184
01:03:39,908 --> 01:03:41,546
She has black hair
and brown eyes

1185
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:43,419
and she hangs around
with that thing!

1186
01:03:43,468 --> 01:03:44,662
Uh...

1187
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:48,340
We know her.

1188
01:03:48,388 --> 01:03:50,822
Bring her back.

1189
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,779
Oh, we can't do that. Uh-uh.

1190
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:55,296
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

1191
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:59,227
See, problem is...
we'rejust here for him.

1192
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,463
So she's gone?

1193
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:02,782
Look at the bright side.

1194
01:04:02,828 --> 01:04:05,023
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

1195
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:15,465
Come.

1196
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:26,696
O'hana.

1197
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:27,703
Huh?

1198
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:29,022
Hey! Get away from her.

1199
01:04:29,068 --> 01:04:31,024
No! What did you say?

1200
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:34,947
O'hana means family.

1201
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:36,706
Family means...

1202
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,308
...nobody gets left behind.

1203
01:04:39,348 --> 01:04:41,100
Or forgotten.

1204
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:42,467
Yeah.

1205
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:46,226
Hey...

1206
01:04:46,268 --> 01:04:49,340
What?!
After all you put me through

1207
01:04:49,388 --> 01:04:52,346
you expect me to help you
just like that?!

1208
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,060
Just like that?!

1209
01:04:54,108 --> 01:04:55,302
<i>lh</i>.

1210
01:04:55,348 --> 01:04:56,906
Fine.

1211
01:04:56,948 --> 01:04:58,620
Fine? You're doing what he says?

1212
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:00,818
Uh, he's very persuasive.

1213
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:04,258
Persuasive?!
What exactly are we doing?

1214
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:05,297
Rescue.

1215
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:06,747
We're going to get Lilo?

1216
01:05:06,788 --> 01:05:07,937
<i>lh</i>.

1217
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:13,066
Oh, good! I was hoping
to add theft, endangerment

1218
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,941
and insanity to my list
of things I did today.

1219
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:17,262
You, too?

1220
01:05:22,908 --> 01:05:24,546
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1221
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,137
What?
Did you think we walked here?

1222
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:31,180
This is Gantu,
requesting hyperspace clearance.

1223
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,219
Stand by for clearance.

1224
01:06:15,548 --> 01:06:18,745
Clearance is granted
on vector C-12.

1225
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:20,585
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

1226
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:21,743
Gantu, what's going on?

1227
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:23,187
I thought you'd like to know

1228
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:27,187
that the little abomination
is... is...

1229
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:32,099
Yes, Captain?

1230
01:06:34,388 --> 01:06:36,822
I'll call you back.

1231
01:06:40,868 --> 01:06:42,824
How did you get out of there?

1232
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:48,264
So what exactly are we doing?

1233
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,617
Don't worry,
is all part of plan.

1234
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:52,181
We are professionals.

1235
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:54,617
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

1236
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,783
Hold on!

1237
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:15,027
Okay, is show time!

1238
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:29,901
This is it!

1239
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:37,100
Go! Go! Go!

1240
01:07:48,508 --> 01:07:51,102
Little savage! Get off my ship!

1241
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:57,021
Stitch!

1242
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:13,137
Computer,
locate Experiment 6-2-6.

1243
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:15,383
6-2-6 located.

1244
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:17,419
We fiinish this now.

1245
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:21,427
Stitch is unconscious.

1246
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:22,662
What do we do now?

1247
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:23,743
We stay close.

1248
01:08:23,788 --> 01:08:24,982
Hope for a miracle.

1249
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:26,541
That's all we can do.

1250
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:38,536
No!

1251
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:42,224
Don't leave me, okay?

1252
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:43,417
Okay.

1253
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,665
Okay.

1254
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:53,664
Okay.

1255
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,420
Target 6-2-6 is in motion.

1256
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:03,696
Speed is 84.

1257
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:05,784
Impossible!

1258
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:31,343
Stitch!

1259
01:09:31,388 --> 01:09:32,377
Hmm?

1260
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:35,181
Abomination.

1261
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:36,502
Stupidhead.

1262
01:09:41,388 --> 01:09:43,026
Yee-haw!

1263
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:46,343
Aloha!

1264
01:09:46,388 --> 01:09:48,265
You're vile! You're foul!

1265
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:49,980
You're flawed!

1266
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:52,588
Also cute and fluffy!

1267
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,300
You came back.

1268
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:08,498
Nobody gets left behind.

1269
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:17,857
Lilo!

1270
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:25,386
Good dog.

1271
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:41,940
Auwe!

1272
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,944
David!

1273
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:45,023
Hey, Lilo.

1274
01:10:45,068 --> 01:10:47,184
Can you give us a ride
to shore?

1275
01:10:47,228 --> 01:10:48,661
Uh...

1276
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,017
Sure!

1277
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:53,741
But I have to make two trips.

1278
01:10:54,468 --> 01:10:56,424
So you're from outer space, huh?

1279
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:57,901
I heard the surfiing's choice.

1280
01:10:57,948 --> 01:11:00,178
We have 6-2-6.

1281
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:01,980
Take him to my ship.

1282
01:11:02,028 --> 01:11:02,983
Leave him alone.

1283
01:11:03,028 --> 01:11:04,177
Hold on.

1284
01:11:04,228 --> 01:11:06,139
Grand Councilwoman,
let me explain.

1285
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:07,416
Silence!

1286
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:11,347
I am retiring you,
Captain Gantu.

1287
01:11:11,388 --> 01:11:14,107
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

1288
01:11:14,148 --> 01:11:15,422
Goes to me.

1289
01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:17,936
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a FluffTrog farm

1290
01:11:17,988 --> 01:11:19,785
after we sort this thing out.

1291
01:11:19,828 --> 01:11:21,056
Uh...

1292
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:22,097
I think I should...

1293
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,183
You!

1294
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:24,377
You're the cause of all this!

1295
01:11:24,428 --> 01:11:26,020
If it wasn't
for your Experiment 6-2-6

1296
01:11:26,068 --> 01:11:27,023
none of this...

1297
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:28,899
Stitch.

1298
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:30,222
What?

1299
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:31,940
My name Stitch.

1300
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,262
Stitch, then.

1301
01:11:33,308 --> 01:11:36,266
If it wasn't for Stitch...

1302
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,778
Does Stitch have to go
in the ship?

1303
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,467
Yes.

1304
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:44,419
Can Stitch say good-bye?

1305
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,067
Yes.

1306
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:48,985
Thank you.

1307
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,706
Who are you?

1308
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,622
This is my family.

1309
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:03,343
I found it all on my own.

1310
01:12:03,388 --> 01:12:06,698
It's little and broken...

1311
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:08,739
but still good.

1312
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:11,348
Yeah. Still good.

1313
01:12:20,748 --> 01:12:23,467
Does he really have to go?

1314
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:27,137
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

1315
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:30,658
I cannot change
what the Council has decided.

1316
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:34,701
Lilo, didn't you buy
that thing at the shelter?

1317
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:39,582
Hey!

1318
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:44,305
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

1319
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:46,145
I paid two dollars for him.

1320
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:48,019
See this stamp? I own him.

1321
01:12:48,068 --> 01:12:49,581
If you take him

1322
01:12:49,628 --> 01:12:51,539
you're stealing.

1323
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:56,140
Aliens are all about rules.

1324
01:12:56,188 --> 01:12:58,577
You look familiar.

1325
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:02,701
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

1326
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:05,467
Ah, yes. You had hair then.

1327
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:07,817
Take note of this.

1328
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:12,225
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile

1329
01:13:12,268 --> 01:13:17,137
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here...

1330
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:21,545
on Earth...

1331
01:13:21,588 --> 01:13:25,342
and as caretaker
of the alien life-form, Stitch

1332
01:13:25,388 --> 01:13:29,347
this family is now
under the offiicial protection

1333
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:32,141
of the United Galactic
Federation.

1334
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:35,066
We'll be checking in
now and then.

1335
01:13:35,108 --> 01:13:37,668
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

1336
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:41,144
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

1337
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:44,498
I know what you mean.

1338
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:50,227
Don't let those two get
on my ship.

1339
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:00,981
CIA?

1340
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:01,983
Former.

1341
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:03,984
Saved the planet once.

1342
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:06,144
Convinced an alien race
that mosquitoes

1343
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,746
were an endangered species.

1344
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:10,177
Now, about your house...

1345
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:14,786
Wait.

1346
01:14:23,628 --> 01:14:28,065
Lord Almighty,
I feel my temperature rising

1347
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,064
Ooh

1348
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:31,541
Higher and higher

1349
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:36,059
It's burning through
to my soul

1350
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:37,985
Baby, baby, baby

1351
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:40,258
You're gonna set me on fiire

1352
01:14:40,308 --> 01:14:42,424
Yeah

1353
01:14:42,468 --> 01:14:43,742
My brain is flaming

1354
01:14:43,788 --> 01:14:45,983
I don't know which way to go

1355
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:48,223
Yeah

1356
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:50,987
'Cause your kisses
lift me higher

1357
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:54,418
Like the sweet song of a choir

1358
01:14:54,468 --> 01:14:56,504
You light my morning sky

1359
01:14:56,548 --> 01:14:59,824
With burning love

1360
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:02,098
Mmm... ooh, ooh, ooh

1361
01:15:02,148 --> 01:15:04,423
I feel my temperature rising

1362
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:06,902
Mmm

1363
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:08,222
Help me, I'm flaming

1364
01:15:08,268 --> 01:15:12,864
I must be a hundred and nine

1365
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:15,263
Burning, burning, burning

1366
01:15:15,308 --> 01:15:17,185
And nothing can cool me

1367
01:15:17,228 --> 01:15:18,900
Mmm

1368
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:21,508
ljust might turn into smoke

1369
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:25,461
But I feel fiine, yeah

1370
01:15:25,508 --> 01:15:28,466
'Cause your kisses
lift me higher

1371
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:31,705
Like a sweet song of a choir

1372
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:33,864
And you light my morning sky

1373
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:35,739
With burning love

1374
01:15:35,788 --> 01:15:38,507
Burning love

1375
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:41,062
Mmm

1376
01:15:45,468 --> 01:15:47,504
Burning love

1377
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:51,257
It's coming closer

1378
01:15:51,308 --> 01:15:56,587
The flames are
now licking my body

1379
01:15:56,628 --> 01:15:58,186
Won't you help me?

1380
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:00,583
I feel like I'm slipping away

1381
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:02,823
Oh, yeah

1382
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:04,381
It's hard to breathe

1383
01:16:04,428 --> 01:16:06,817
And my chest isjust a-heaving

1384
01:16:06,868 --> 01:16:09,018
Mmm, mmm

1385
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:13,107
Lord have mercy,

1386
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,900
Yeah

1387
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:17,416
'Cause your kisses

1388
01:16:17,468 --> 01:16:21,143
Like the sweet song of a choir

01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:23,258
You light my morning sky

1390
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:25,139
With burning love

1391

ljust can't help
falling in love with you

1406
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:24,264
Wise men say

1407

01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:36,543
Falling in love with you

1410
01:17:36,588 --> 01:17:39,500
Shall I stay?

1411
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:44,019
Would it be a sin?

1412
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:47,378
If I can't help

1413
01:17:47,428 --> 01:17:51,944
Falling in love with you

So it goes,
