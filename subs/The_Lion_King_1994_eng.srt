2
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,320
From the day we arrive on the planet

3
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,160
And, blinking, step into the sun

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,570
There's more to see than can ever be seen

5
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,630
More to do than can ever be done

6
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,940
There's far too much to take in here

7
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,250
More to find than can ever be found

8
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,520
But the sun rolling high

9
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,120
Through the sapphire sky

10
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,190
Keeps great and small on the endless round

11
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,500
It's the circle of life

12
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,540
And it moves us all

13
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,880
Through despair and hope

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,050
Through faith and love

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,080
Till we find our place

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,630
On the path unwinding

17
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,270
In the circle

18
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,300
The circle of life

19
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,280
It's the circle of life

20
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,890
And it moves us all

21
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,690
Through despair and hope

22
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,700
Through faith and love

23
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,200
Till we find our place

24
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,810
On the path unwinding

25
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,920
In the circle

26
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,330
The circle of life

27
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,400
Life's not fair, is it?

28
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,560
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

29
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,900
And you shall never see the light of another day.

30
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,930
Adieu.

31
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,210
Didn't your mother tell you not to play with your food?

32
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,210
What do you want?

33
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way.

34
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,690
So you'd better have a good excuse...

35
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,350
for missing the ceremony this morning.

36
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,410
Oh, now, look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.

37
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,860
Ha! You'll lose more than that...

38
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,380
when the king gets through with you.

39
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,090
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

40
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,690
Ooh. I quiver with fear!

41
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,100
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,800
Help!

43
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,700
Drop him.

44
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,510
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

45
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,950
Why, if it isn't my big brother...

46
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,420
descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.

47
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,550
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

48
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,680
That was today?

49
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,990
Oh, I feel simply awful!

50
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,330
Must've slipped my mind.

51
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is...

52
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,730
as the king's brother...

53
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,500
you should've been first in line!

54
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,560
Well, I was first in line...

55
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,580
until the little hairball was born.

56
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,410
That hairball is my son...

57
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,610
and your future king.

58
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,450
Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.

59
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,080
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,350
Oh, no, Mufasa.

61
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,360
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

62
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,550
Is that a challenge?

63
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,260
Temper, temper.

64
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,230
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

65
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,290
Pity. Why not?

66
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,700
As far as brains go, I got the lion's share.

67
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,140
But when it comes to brute strength...

68
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,340
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.

69
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,110
There's one in every family, sire.

70
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,210
Two in mine, actually...

71
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,950
and they always manage to ruin special occasions.

72
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,010
What am I going to do with him?

73
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,890
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

74
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,020
Zazu!

75
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,500
And just think, whenever he gets dirty...

76
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,860
you could take him out and beat him.

77
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,370
Simba.

78
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,220
Dad! Dad!

79
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,720
Come on, Dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

80
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
Sorry.

81
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,530
Dad. Dad.

82
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,870
Your son is awake.

83
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,640
Before sunrise, he's your son.

84
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,700
Dad! Come on, Dad.

85
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,070
You promised.

86
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,140
- OK, OK. I'm up, I'm up. - Yeah!

87
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,970
Look, Simba.

88
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,270
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

89
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,110
Wow.

90
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,050
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.

91
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,450
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here...

92
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,620
and will rise with you as the new king.

93
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,350
- And this'll all be mine? - Everything.

94
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,690
Everything the light touches.

95
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,990
What about that shadowy place?

96
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,330
That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.

97
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,390
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.

98
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
There's more to being king...

99
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,000
than getting your way all the time.

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,240
- There's more? - Simba...

101
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,780
Everything you see exists together...

102
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,550
in a delicate balance.

103
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,580
As king, you need to understand that balance...

104
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,350
and respect all the creatures...

105
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,590
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

106
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,590
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

107
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,190
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

108
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,130
When we die, our bodies become the grass...

109
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,730
and the antelope eat the grass.

110
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,400
And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.

111
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,670
- Good morning, sire! - Good morning, Zazu.

112
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,510
Checking in with the morning report.

113
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,740
Fire away.

114
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,870
Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all

115
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,890
Elephants remember, though just what, I can't recall

116
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,950
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks

117
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,360
Shown interest in my nest egg, but I quickly said, no, thanks

118
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,390
We haven't paid the hornbills, and the vultures have a hunch

119
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,490
Not everyone invited will be coming back from lunch

120
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,270
This is the morning report

121
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,740
Gives you the long and the short

122
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,800
Every grunt, roar, and snort

123
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,870
Not a tale I distort

124
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,210
On the morning report

125
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,480
- What are you doing, son? - Pouncing.

126
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,460
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

127
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,460
Oh, the buffalo have got a beef about...

128
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,160
Stay low to the ground.

129
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,720
Yeah, OK. Stay low to the ground. Right.

130
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,890
Not a sound.

131
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,490
The season's colors seen in all the herds...

132
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,670
Take it slow. One more step...

133
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,970
- then... ...in the dung

134
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,940
This is the morning report

135
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,280
Gives you the long and the short

136
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,340
Every grunt, roar, and snort

137
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,820
Not a tale I distort

138
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,320
On the morning report

139
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,350
- Zazu! - Yes!

140
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,120
Sir! News from the underground.

141
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,380
Now, this time...

142
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,050
Sire! Hyenas in the pride lands!

143
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,320
Zazu, take Simba home.

144
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
- Dad, can't I come? - No, son.

145
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,360
I never get to go anywhere.

146
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,130
Oh, young master, one day, you will be king.

147
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,200
Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy...

148
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,570
stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,090
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,320
I despise guessing games.

151
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock.

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,580
Oh, goody.

153
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,650
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom...

154
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,530
and I'm gonna rule it all.

155
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,300
Yes, well, forgive me for not leaping for joy.

156
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,400
Bad back, you know.

157
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,180
Hey, Uncle Scar, when I'm king, what'll that make you?

158
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,410
A monkey's uncle.

159
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,180
You're so weird.

160
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,180
You have no idea.

161
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,850
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?

162
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,910
Everything.

163
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,750
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise...

164
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,280
at the northern border?

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,890
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

166
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,360
And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous.

167
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,890
Only the bravest lions go there.

168
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,700
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

169
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,930
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

170
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,170
Why not?

171
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,110
Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out...

172
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,840
for the well-being of my favorite nephew.

173
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,750
Yeah, right. I'm your only nephew.

174
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,340
All the more reason for me to be protective.

175
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,680
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.

176
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,210
An elephant what? Whoa.

177
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,390
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

178
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...

179
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,400
you being so clever and all.

180
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,160
Oh, just do me one favor.

181
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,870
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.

182
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,070
- No problem. - There's a good lad.

183
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,910
You run along now and have fun.

184
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,940
And remember, it's our little secret.

185
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,750
- Hey, Nala. - Hi, Simba.

186
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,060
Come on. I just heard about this great place.

187
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,560
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.

188
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,660
And it's time for yours.

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,330
Mom!

190
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,000
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

191
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,870
OK, I'm clean. Can we go now?

192
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,900
So, where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb.

193
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,780
No, it's really cool.

194
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,410
So, where is this really cool place?

195
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,350
Oh. Around the water hole.

196
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,480
The water hole? What's so great about the water hole?

197
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,720
I'll show you when we get there.

198
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,960
Oh. Mom, can I go with Simba?

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,120
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

200
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,320
Well...

201
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,830
- Please? - Please?

202
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,030
It's all right with me.

203
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,190
- All right! - Yeah!

204
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,140
As long as Zazu goes with you.

205
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,200
No, not Zazu.

206
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,140
Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole...

207
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,300
the sooner we can leave.

208
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,280
So, where are we really going?

209
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,840
- An elephant graveyard. - Wow!

210
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,610
Shh! Zazu.

211
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,380
Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo?

212
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,390
Oh, just look at you two.

213
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,620
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna.

214
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,920
Your parents will be thrilled...

215
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,330
what with your being betrothed and all.

216
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,230
- Be... what? - Betrothed. Intended.

217
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,200
Affianced.

218
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,360
Meaning...?

219
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,530
One day, you two are going to be married.

220
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,840
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

221
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,140
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

222
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,170
Sorry to bust your bubble...

223
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,880
but you two turtledoves have no choice.

224
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,440
It's a tradition going back generations.

225
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,120
When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.

226
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,020
- Not so long as I'm around. - In that case, you're fired.

227
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,530
Hmm. Nice try, but only the king can do that.

228
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,190
Well, he's the future king.

229
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

230
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,570
Not yet, I don't. And with an attitude like that...

231
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,190
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be...

232
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,830
a pretty pathetic king indeed.

233
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,170
Hmm. Not the way I see it.

234
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,410
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware

235
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,110
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts

236
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,180
With quite so little hair

237
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm gonna be the main event like no king was before

238
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,050
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down

239
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,620
I'm workin' on my roar

240
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,160
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.

241
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,970
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,340
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

243
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,500
- No one sayin', "Do this" - Now, when I said that...

244
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,980
- No one saying, "Be there" - What I meant was...

245
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,610
- No one sayin', "Stop that" - But what you don't realize...

246
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,510
- No one sayin', "See here" - Now, see here!

247
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,450
Free to run around all day

248
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,480
Well, that's definitely out.

249
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,510
Free to do it all my way

250
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,820
I think it's time that you and I

251
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,300
Arranged a heart-to-heart

252
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,460
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

253
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out

254
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:26,140
Out of service, out of Africa, I wouldn't hang about

255
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,120
This child is getting wildly out of wing

256
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,090
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

257
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,870
Everybody, look left

258
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,840
Everybody, look right

259
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,240
Everywhere you look, I'm standing in the spotlight

260
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,840
Not yet!

261
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,780
Let every creature go for broke and sing

262
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,150
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing

263
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,390
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

264
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,390
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

265
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

266
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:26,400
Oh, I just can't wait

267
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,210
To be king

268
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,290
I beg your pardon, madam, but... get off!

269
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,360
All right! It worked!

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,960
- We lost him. - I am a genius.

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,970
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

273
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,300
- With me! - Oh, yeah?

274
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,940
- Pinned ya. - Hey, let me up.

275
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,780
Pinned ya again.

276
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
This is it. We made it.

277
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,440
It's really creepy.

278
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,950
Yeah. Isn't it great?

279
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,970
- We could get in big trouble. - I know.

280
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,210
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

281
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,120
There's only one way to know. Come on, let's go check it out.

282
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,650
Wrong! The only checking out you will do...

283
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,920
will be to check out of here.

284
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,120
Oh, man!

285
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,720
We're way beyond the boundary of the pride lands.

286
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,390
Look, Banana Beak is scared.

287
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,330
It's Mr. Banana Beak to you, fuzzy...

288
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,740
and right now we are all in very real danger.

289
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,400
Danger? Ha! I walk on the wide side.

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,740
I laugh in the face of danger.

291
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,850
Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here?

292
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,830
Hmm. I don't know, Shenzi. What do you think, Ed?

293
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,360
Just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers!

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,730
And quite by accident, let me assure you.

295
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,640
A simple navigational error.

296
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,660
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

297
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,640
I know you. You're Mufasa's little stooge.

298
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,040
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

299
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,170
- And that would make you... - The future king.

300
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,780
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?

301
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,620
You can't do anything to me.

302
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,020
Technically, they can. We are on their land.

303
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,920
But, Zazu, you told me they're nothin'...

304
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,330
but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

305
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,860
- Lx-nay on the upid-stay. - Who are you callin' upid-stay?

306
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,130
My, my, my. Look at the sun! It's time to go!

307
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,330
What's the hurry? We'd love you to stick around for dinner.

308
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,830
Yeah, we could have whatever's lion around!

309
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,840
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

310
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,970
Make mine a cub sandwich! What'd you think?

311
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,780
What, Ed? What is it?

312
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,620
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

313
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,110
- No, why? - 'Cause there it goes!

314
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,060
- Did we lose 'em? - I think so.

315
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,570
Where's Zazu?

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped...

317
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,900
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

318
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,470
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

319
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,610
Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

320
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,910
- Like you? - Oops.

321
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,520
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

322
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,120
That was it?

323
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,860
Do it again. Come on.

324
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,370
Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!

325
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,740
- Silence! - We're gonna shut up right now!

326
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,540
Calm down. We're really sorry.

327
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,980
If you ever come near my son again...

328
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,650
Oh, this is your son?

329
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,920
- Oh, your son? - Did you know that?

330
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,420
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

331
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,360
- No, of course not. - No.

332
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,590
- Ed? - Ed?

333
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,200
Toodles.

334
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,540
Dad, l...

335
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,370
You deliberately disobeyed me.

336
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,450
- Dad, I'm sorry. - Let's go home.

337
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,640
I thought you were very brave.

338
00:00:00,100 --> 00:22:49,570
- Yes, sire? - Take Nala home.

339
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,600
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

340
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,720
Come, Nala.

341
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,190
Simba, good luck.

342
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,690
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

343
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,190
- I know. - You could've been killed.

344
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,030
You deliberately disobeyed me...

345
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,660
and what's worse, you put Nala in danger.

346
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,700
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

347
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,070
I'm only brave when I have to be.

348
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,840
Simba, being brave...

349
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,280
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

350
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,280
But you're not scared of anything.

351
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,680
I was today.

352
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,910
- You were? - Yes.

353
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,150
I thought I might lose you.

354
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,490
Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?

355
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,830
- But you know what? - What?

356
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,990
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

357
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,200
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

358
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,760
- Come here, you. - Oh, no! No!

359
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,740
Come here!

360
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,940
Gotcha!

361
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,780
- Dad? - Hmm?

362
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,620
- We're pals, right? - Right.

363
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,420
And we'll always be together, right?

364
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,600
Simba, let me tell you something...

365
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,390
that my father told me.

366
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,430
Look at the stars.

367
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,870
The great kings of the past...

368
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,530
Iook down on us from those stars.

369
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,910
- Really? - Yes.

370
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,340
So, whenever you feel alone...

371
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,680
just remember that those kings...

372
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,620
will always be there to guide you...

373
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,050
and so will I.

374
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,690
Man, that lousy Mufasa.

375
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,820
I won't be able to sit for a week.

376
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,730
It's not funny, Ed.

377
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,160
Hey, shut up!

378
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,140
Will you knock it off?

379
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,810
Well, he started it.

380
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,580
Look at you guys.

381
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,110
No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.

382
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,680
Man, I hate dangling.

383
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,160
Yeah? You know, if it weren't for those lions...

384
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,660
we'd be runnin' the joint.

385
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,160
Man, I hate lions.

386
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,790
- So pushy. - And hairy.

387
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,990
- And stinky. - And, man, are they...

388
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,360
- Ugly! - Ugly!

389
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,270
Oh, surely, we lions are not all that bad.

390
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,170
Oh, Scar. It's just you.

391
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,330
We were afraid it was somebody important.

392
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,840
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

393
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,500
- Yeah. - I see.

394
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,950
- Now, that's power. - Tell me about it.

395
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,110
I just hear that name, and I shudder.

396
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,380
- Mufasa! - Ooh! Do it again.

397
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,290
Ooh, it tingles me.

398
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,230
I'm surrounded by idiots.

399
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,060
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us.

400
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,660
- I mean, you're our pal. - Charmed.

401
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,400
Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.

402
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
Did you bring us anything to eat, Scar, old buddy?

403
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,030
Did ya, did ya, did ya?

404
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,470
I don't think you really deserve this.

405
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,640
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you...

406
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,140
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

407
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,780
You know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.

408
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,950
Yeah. What were we supposed to do, kill Mufasa?

409
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,630
Precisely.

410
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,100
I know that your powers of retention

411
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,910
Are as wet as a warthog's backside

412
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,010
But thick as you are

413
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,180
Pay attention

414
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,020
My words are a matter of pride

415
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,790
It's clear from your vacant expressions

416
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,790
The lights are not all on upstairs

417
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,290
But we're talking kings and successions

418
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,530
Even you can't be caught unawares

419
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,070
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime

420
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,570
Be prepared for sensational news

421
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,380
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer

422
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,080
And where do we feature?

423
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,350
Just listen to teacher

424
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,320
I know it sounds sordid

425
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,380
But you'll be rewarded

426
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,880
When at last I am given my dues

427
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,730
And injustice deliciously squared

428
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,000
Be prepared

429
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, be prepared. We'll be prepared. For what?

430
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,800
- For the death of the king. - Why, is he sick?

431
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,610
No, fool, we're going to kill him... and Simba, too.

432
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,480
Great idea. Who needs a king?

433
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,180
No king, no king, la-la la-la la la

434
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,340
Idiots! There will be a king!

435
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,450
- Hey, but you said... - I will be king!

436
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,190
Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again.

437
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,200
- Yeah! - Yeah! All right!

438
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,590
All right! Long live the king!

439
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,120
- Long live the king! - Long live the king!

440
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,900
King, king, king, king, king, king, king

441
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,240
It's great that we'll soon be connected

442
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,540
With a king who'll be all-time adored

443
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,140
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected

444
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,210
To take certain duties on board

445
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,050
The future is littered with prizes

446
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,550
And though I'm the main addressee

447
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,960
The point that I must emphasize is

448
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,900
You won't get a sniff without me

449
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,560
So prepare for the coup of the century

450
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,940
Be prepared for the murkiest scam

451
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,770
Meticulous planning

452
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,780
Tenacity spanning

453
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,910
Decades of denial

454
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,650
Is simply why I'll be king undisputed

455
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,680
Respected, saluted

456
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,120
And seen for the wonder I am

457
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,960
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

458
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,360
Be prepared

459
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,770
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

460
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,330
Be prepared

461
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,010
Now, you wait here.

462
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,490
Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.

463
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,850
Ooh, what is it?

464
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,090
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now, would it?

465
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,120
If you tell me, I'll still act surprised.

466
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,100
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.

467
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,360
- Come on, Uncle Scar. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

468
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,770
This is just for you and your daddy.

469
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,540
You know, a sort of father-son... thing.

470
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,410
Well, I better go get him.

471
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,000
- I'll go with you. - No!

472
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,820
No. Just stay on this rock.

473
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,980
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess...

474
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,720
like you did with the hyenas.

475
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,120
You know about that?

476
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,590
Simba, everybody knows about that.

477
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,260
- Really? - Oh, yes.

478
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,060
Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh?

479
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,870
Oh, and just between us...

480
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,340
you might want to work on that little roar of yours.

481
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, OK.

482
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,610
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?

483
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,950
Simba, it's to die for.

484
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,740
- Shut up. - I can't help it.

485
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,210
I'm so hungry. I got to have a wildebeest.

486
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,740
Stay put.

487
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,050
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?

488
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,040
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

489
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,490
There he is. Let's go.

490
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,190
Little roar.

491
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,150
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.

492
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,160
- Odd. - Mufasa, quick!

493
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
Stampede in the gorge.

494
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,060
- Simba's down there. - Simba?

495
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,750
Zazu, help me!

496
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,880
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

497
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,090
Hurry!

498
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,290
There, on that tree.

499
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,600
Hold on, Simba!

500
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,980
Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do?

501
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,240
I'll go back to help, that's what I'll do.

502
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,440
I'll go back...

503
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,370
Dad!

504
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,610
Brother! Help me!

505
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,250
Long live the king.

506
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,710
Dad!

507
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,700
Dad, come on.

508
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,640
You got to get up.

509
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,770
Dad?

510
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,710
We got to go home.

511
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,720
Help!

512
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,350
Somebody!

513
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,230
Anybody.

514
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,960
Help.

515
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,730
Simba, what have you done?

516
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,200
There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me.

517
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,540
It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen.

518
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,770
Of course, of course you didn't.

519
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,770
No one ever means for these things to happen...

520
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,150
but the king is dead.

521
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,780
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.

522
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,120
Oh, what will your mother think?

523
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,730
What am I going to do?

524
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,100
Run away, Simba.

525
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,600
Run. Run away and never return.

526
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,250
Kill him.

527
00:38:09,305 --> 00:39:09,360
