00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,240
We're under attack!
Light the signal!

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040
- Light the fire now!
- Light the signal!

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
Now all of China
knows you're here.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
Perfect.

6
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,040
Your Majesty, the Huns have
crossed our Northern border.

7
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
Impossible.
No one can get through the Great Wall.

8
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Shan-Yu is leading them.

9
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,160
We'll set up defenses
around your palace immediately.

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,960
No. Send your troops
to protect my people. Chi Fu.

11
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,560
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.

12
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,840
Call up reserves and
as many new recruits as possible.

13
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,880
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I believe my troops can stop him.

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,280
I won't take
any chances, General.

15
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,000
A single grain of rice
can tip the scale.

16
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,000
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

17
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
"Quiet and demure.

18
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Graceful. Polite.

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
Delicate.

20
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Refined. Poised.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,080
Punctual. "

22
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:15,720
Punctual. "

23
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,520
Ai-yah!
Little Brother!

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,600
Little Brother. Lit-

25
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,760
Ah! There you are.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
- Who's the smartest doggy in
the world? Come on, smart boy.

27
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,320
Can you help me with my chores today?

28
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,920
Honorable ancestors,

29
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,960
please help Mulan
impress the Matchmaker today.

30
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Please.

31
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,320
Please help her.

32
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,400
Father, I brought your-
Whoa!

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
- Mulan.
- I brought a spare.

34
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
- Mulan.
- Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning...

35
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,360
- Mulan.
- and three at night.

36
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,480
Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you-

37
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,125
To uphold the family honor.

38
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,400
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm going to...
pray some more.

41
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
Fa Li, is your daughter
here yet?

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,720
The Matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Of all days to be late-I should have
prayed to the ancestors for luck.

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,520
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,320
- Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

46
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,040
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

47
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,920
Grandma, no!

48
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,080
Yep, this cricket's
a lucky one!

49
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm here.

50
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,080
What? But Mama,
I had to-

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,800
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

52
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
This is what you give me
to work with

53
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Well, honey
I've seen worse

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,880
We're gonna turn this sow's ear

55
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,680
- into a silk purse
- It's freezing.

56
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,080
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

57
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,840
We'll have you
washed and dried

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,520
Primped and polished
till you glow with pride

59
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,280
Trust my recipe
for instant bride

60
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,880
You'll bring honor
to us all

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,880
- Mulan, what's this?
- Uh, notes,

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,840
in case
I forget something.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Hold this.
We'll need more luck than I thought.

64
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Wait and see
when we're through

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Boys will gladly
go to war for you

66
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,520
- With good fortune
- And a great hairdo

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,640
You'll bring honor to us all

68
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,640
A girl can bring
her family

69
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Great honor in one way

70
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,480
- By striking a good match
- Huh?

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,840
- And this could be the day
- Ha, ha, ha!

72
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,080
Men want girls
with good taste

73
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,760
- Calm. - Obedient.
- Who work fast-paced

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,680
- With good breeding
- And a tiny waist

75
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,960
You'll bring honor to us all

76
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,840
We all must serve
our Emperor

77
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
Who guards us
from the Huns

78
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
The men by bearing arms

79
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,280
A girl by bearing sons

80
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,440
When we're through you can't fail

81
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,240
Like a lotus blossom
soft and pale

82
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,040
How could any fellow
say no sale

83
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,960
You'll bring honor
to us all

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,960
There.
You're ready.

85
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,640
Not yet.
An apple for serenity.

86
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,280
A pendant for balance.

87
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,520
Beads of jade

88
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,400
For beauty

89
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,240
You must proudly

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,560
Show it

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,240
Now add a cricket

92
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,560
Just for luck

93
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,640
And even you
can't blow it

94
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
Ancestors
Hear my plea

95
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,720
Help me not to make
a fool of me

96
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,440
And to not uproot
my family tree

97
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,720
Keep my father
standing tall

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,440
Scarier than
the undertaker

99
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,360
We are meeting
our Matchmaker

100
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,760
Destiny Guard our girls

101
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,640
And our future
as it fast unfurls

102
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Please look kindly
on these cultured pearls

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,280
Each a perfect
porcelain doll

104
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,080
- Please bring honor to us
- Please bring honor to us

105
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,000
- Please bring honor to us
- Please bring honor to us

106
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Please bring honor
to us all

107
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,285
"Fa Mulan. "

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,560
- Present.
- Speaking without permission.

109
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:54,680
- Oops.
- Who spit in her bean curd?

110
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Huh. Hmm.

111
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,200
Mmm. Too skinny.

112
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,000
Hmph! Not good
for bearing sons.

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,240
Recite the
final admonition.

114
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Mm-hmm.

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Well?

116
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,240
Fulfill your duties
calmly and... respectfully.

117
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,960
Um, reflect before you snack-

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Act! This shall bring you
honor and glory.

119
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,120
Hmm. This way.

120
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,200
Now, pour the tea.

121
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,525
To please
your future in-laws,

122
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,320
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity...

123
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
and refinement.

124
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,680
You must also be poised.

125
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,560
- Um, pardon me.
- And silent!

126
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Ahhh.

127
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
Could I just take that back?

128
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,525
One moment.

129
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,240
Why, you clumsy-

130
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,560
Whoo! Whoo! Aaah! Whoo! Aaah!

131
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,880
I think it's going well, don't you?

132
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,840
Put it out! Put it out!
Put it out!

133
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,405
You are a disgrace!

134
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,525
You may look like a bride,

135
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,160
but you will never
bring your family honor!

136
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,600
Look at me

137
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,840
I will never pass

138
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,320
For a perfect bride

139
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,280
Or a perfect daughter

140
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
Can it be

141
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm not meant
to play this part

142
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Now I see

143
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,800
That if I were truly
to be myself

144
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,640
I would break
my family's heart

145
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,320
Who is that girl I see

146
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,640
Staring straight

147
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,840
Back at me

148
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,560
Why is my reflection

149
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,600
Someone I don't know

150
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,600
Somehow I cannot hide

151
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,600
Who I am

152
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,280
Though I've tried

153
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,200
When will
my reflection show

154
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,800
Who I am inside

155
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,880
When will
my reflection show

156
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Who I am

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
Inside

158
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,640
My, my.

159
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,440
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

160
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,400
But, look,
this one's late.

161
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,920
But I'll bet that
when it blooms,

162
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,120
it will be
the most beautiful of all.

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
What is it?

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Mulan.

165
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,400
Stay inside.

166
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,920
Citizens, I bring
a proclamation...

167
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,000
from the Imperial City.

168
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,200
The Huns have invaded China.

169
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,320
By order of the Emperor,

170
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,840
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial Army.

171
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,600
The Hsiao family.

172
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,920
The Yi family.

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,440
I will serve the Emperor
in my father's place.

174
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,040
- The Fa family.
- No!

175
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
I am ready to serve
the Emperor.

176
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,720
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!

177
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,000
- Please, sir, my father has
already fought bravely- - Silence!

178
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,720
You would do well to teach your daughter
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.

179
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,600
Mulan, you dishonor me.

180
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,960
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,640
The Chu family!

183
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,160
The Wen family!

184
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
The Chang family!

185
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,800
- You shouldn't have to go!
- Mulan-

186
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,040
There are plenty of young men
to fight for China.

187
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,000
It is an honor to protect
my country and my family.

188
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,960
So, you'll die for honor.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,360
I will die
doing what's right.

190
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,600
- But if you- - I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.

191
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
Mulan is gone!

192
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,880
What?

193
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,800
It can't be.

194
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,000
Mulan!

195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,760
No.

196
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,880
You must go after her.
She could be killed.

197
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,460
If I reveal her,

198
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:21,880
she will be.

199
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,120
Ancestors, hear our prayer.

200
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:35,520
Watch over Mulan.

201
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,360
Mushu, awaken.

202
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,680
I live!

203
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
So tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

204
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,240
- You just say the word and I'm there.
- Mushu-

205
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
And let me say somethin'. Anybody's who's
foolish enough to threaten our family,

206
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,760
vengeance will be mine!

207
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,325
Mushu!

208
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,040
These are
the family guardians.

209
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,520
- They-
- Protect the family.

210
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,740
And you, O Demoted One?

211
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,880
I... ring the gong.

212
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,120
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

213
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,800
One family reunion comin' right up.

214
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680
Okay, people, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

215
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,520
Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way
past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.

216
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,280
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan
was a troublemaker from the start!

217
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,800
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

218
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,245
She's just trying
to help her father.

219
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,880
But if she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

220
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,040
Dishonor will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

221
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,800
Not to mention,
they'll lose the farm.

222
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,600
My children never caused such trouble.
They all became acupuncturists.

223
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,520
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.
- No!

224
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,680
Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

225
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,000
- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.

226
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,880
No. The swiftest.

227
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,520
- No. Send the wisest.
- Silence!

228
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,360
We must send
the most powerful of all.

229
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Okay, okay,
I get the drift. I'll go.

230
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,760
Oh, y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.

231
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,880
Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

232
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,120
Don't make me have to singe
nobody to prove no point.

233
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,800
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

234
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,440
Your misguidance led
Fa Deng to disaster.

235
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,600
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- And your point is?

236
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,800
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

237
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,040
What-What-
I'm a real dragon!

238
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,560
You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.

239
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

240
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,680
Just one chance,
is that too much to ask?

241
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I mean, it's not like
it'd kill ya.

242
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,120
Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

243
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

244
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,320
Come on.

245
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Hello?

246
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,120
Hel-lo!

247
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,200
Hello!

248
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
Uh-oh.

249
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Uh, Stony?

250
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Stony? Oh, man,
they're gonna kill me.

251
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,600
Great Stone Dragon,

252
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,280
have you awakened?

253
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,720
Uh, uh, uh, uh-
Yes, I just woke up.

254
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,400
I'm-I'm the Great
Stone Dragon. Good morning.

255
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,960
I will go forth
and fetch Mulan.

256
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,160
Did-Did I mention that
I was the Great Stone Dragon?

257
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,120
Go! The fate
of the Fa family...

258
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,640
rests in your claws.

259
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,120
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

260
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,040
My elbow!

261
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,800
I know I twisted somethin'.

262
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,960
That's just great.
Now what?

263
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man decides
to take her little drag show on the road.

264
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,080
Go get her? What's the matter
with you? After this Great Stone,

265
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,880
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her
home with a medal to get back in the temple.

266
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
Wait a minute. That's it!

267
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,240
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be
begging me to come back to work.

268
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,040
That's the master plan.
Ah, you done it now, man.

269
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,240
- Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

270
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,920
You're lucky?

271
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,280
Do I look like a sucker to you?

272
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
What you mean, a loser? How 'bout I pop one
of your antennas off, throw it across the yard?

273
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,360
Then who's the loser, me or you?

274
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
Imperial scouts.

275
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,560
Shan-Yu.

276
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,920
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun Army.

277
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
The Emperor
will stop you.

278
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,680
Stop me?
He invited me.

279
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,000
- By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

280
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
Well, I'm here
to play his game.

281
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,960
Go! Tell your Emperor
to send his strongest armies.

282
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm ready.

283
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,520
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

284
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,080
One.

285
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
Okay, okay,
how about this?

286
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
Excuse me.

287
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,480
Where do I sign in?

288
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one too.

289
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,960
They're very manly
and... tough.

290
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,560
I'm working on it!

291
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,560
Oh, who am I fooling?

292
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,640
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

293
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,560
Did I hear someone ask
for a miracle?

294
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

295
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,120
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

296
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,520
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

297
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,480
For I have been sent
by your ancestors...

298
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,120
to guide you through
your masquerade.

299
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Come on. If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

300
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,520
So heed my word! 'Cause if
the army finds out you're a girl,

301
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,720
the penalty is death!

302
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,720
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who am I?

303
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,040
I am the guardian
of lost souls.

304
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,640
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,

305
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,080
the indestructible Mushu.

306
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

307
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,160
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

308
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,880
Hey, dragon, dragon,
not lizard.

309
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,480
I don't do that tongue thing.

310
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
You're, um-

311
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
Intimidating?
Awe inspiring?

312
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,880
- Tiny.
- Of course. I'm travel size for your convenience.

313
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,600
If I was my real size,
your cow here would die of fright.

314
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,880
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

315
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,080
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!

316
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,040
All right, that's it! Dishonor!
Dishonor on your whole family.

317
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,720
Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis-

318
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,720
Stop. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

320
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,760
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't you slap me no more.

321
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,920
We clear on that?
All right.

322
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,120
Okeydokey. Let's get this show
on the road! Cri-Kee, get the bags.

323
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,680
Let's move it, heifer.

324
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

325
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,760
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

326
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,080
Two, three-Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

327
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,240
- Beautiful, isn't he?
- They're disgusting.

328
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,720
No, they're men. Now, you gonna have to
act just like them, so pay attention.

329
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,040
Look. This tattoo
will protect me from harm.

330
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,965
Hmm.

331
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
- I hope you can
get your money back.

332
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,040
I don't think
I can do this.

333
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,720
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

334
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,840
What are you lookin' at?

335
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,400
Punch him.
It's how men say hello.

336
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,360
Oh, Yao,
you've made a friend.

337
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
Good. Now slap him on the behind.
They like that.

338
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,920
Whoa-ho-ho!

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,680
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

340
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,280
Yao, relax and chant with me.

341
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,680
Feel better?

342
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't
worth my time.

343
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
- Chicken boy.
- Chicken boy?

344
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,720
Say that to my face,
ya limp noodle!

345
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh. Sorry, Ling.

346
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,440
Hey!

347
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,800
Whoa! You're dead!

348
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh, there he goes!

349
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,040
Hey, guys.

350
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,200
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

351
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,080
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

352
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,680
and stop Shan-Yu
before he destroys this village.

353
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Excellent strategy, sir.

354
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,080
I do love surprises.

355
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

356
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,040
When Chi Fu believes
you're ready,

357
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,000
you will join us, Captain.

358
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,960
Captain?

359
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,960
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

360
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,880
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience.

361
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,160
Number one in his class, extensive
knowledge of training techniques,

362
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,680
and impressive
military lineage.

363
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,400
I believe Li Shang will do
an excellent job.

364
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is-I mean-

365
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,560
- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.

366
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,960
We'll toast China's victory
at the Imperial City.

367
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,160
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

368
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
And I won't leave
anything out.

369
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,960
Captain Li Shang.

370
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,880
Hmm.

371
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Leader of China's
finest troops.

372
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,000
No. The greatest troops of all time.

373
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,880
Most impressive.

374
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,440
Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

375
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,400
Good luck, Father.

376
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
Day one.

377
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Soldiers!

378
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,200
He started it!

379
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,320
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

380
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,240
Sorry. Uh-

381
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,000
I mean, uh, sorry you had to see that.

382
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,880
But you know how it is when you get those
manly urges and you just gotta kill somethin',

383
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,360
fix things, cook outdoors-

384
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,960
What's your name?

385
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,600
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

386
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,800
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name too.

387
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,560
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

388
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,480
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

389
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,200
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

390
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,640
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit. Ha, ha. I kill myself.

391
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,200
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

392
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,800
- No.
- Then what is it?

393
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,640
- Ping was my best friend growin' up.
- It's Ping.

394
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,920
- Ping?
- Of course, Ping did steal my-

395
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,200
Yes, my name is Ping.

396
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,760
Let me see your
conscription notice.

397
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,960
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

398
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.

399
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,040
I can see why.
That boy's an absolute lunatic.

400
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,440
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

401
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,160
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

402
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,880
And tomorrow, the real work begins.

403
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,000
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

404
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,320
- All right! Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty.

405
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,520
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

406
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,320
- Get your clothes on. Get ready.
Got breakfast for ya.

407
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,920
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

408
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,520
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

409
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,800
- Am I late?
- No time to talk. Now remember, it's your first day of training,

410
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,680
so listen to your teacher and no
fightin', play nice with the other kids,

411
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,600
unless one of the other kids wanna fight,
then you have to kick the other kid's butt.

412
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,720
- But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

413
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,440
Now let's see your war face.

414
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,240
Oh, I think my bunny slippers just ran
for cover. Come on! Scare me, girl.

415
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Yeah, that's my tough lookin' warrior.

416
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,120
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Now, get out there and make me proud.

417
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,880
- What do you mean, the troops just left?
- They what?

418
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,680
Wait!
You forgot your sword.

419
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,360
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

420
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,200
Order. People, order.

421
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,080
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh, oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

422
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,640
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny.

423
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

424
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,325
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

425
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,880
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

426
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,120
Soldiers!

427
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,480
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

428
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,240
Anyone who acts otherwise...

429
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:20,677
will answer to me.

430
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,080
Eeew. Tough guy.

431
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,200
Yao.

432
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,120
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

433
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,120
I'll get that arrow,
pretty boy,

434
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,360
and I'll do it
with my shirt on.

435
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
One moment. You seem
to be missing something.

436
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,680
This represents discipline,

437
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,360
and this
represents strength.

438
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
You need both
to reach the arrow.

439
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,640
We've got a long way to go.

440
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Let's get down to business

441
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,845
To defeat the Huns

442
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,360
- Hoo-ah!
- Did they send me daughters

443
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
When I asked for sons

444
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,000
You're the saddest bunch
I ever met

445
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,360
But you can bet
before we're through

446
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:59,240
Mister, I'll make a man

447
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,880
Out of you

448
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,440
Tranquil as a forest

449
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,880
But on fire within

450
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,240
Once you find your center

451
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,045
You are sure to win

452
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,880
You're a spineless, pale
pathetic lot

453
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:27,480
And you haven't got a clue

454
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,360
Somehow I'll
make a man

455
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,800
Out of you

456
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,320
I'm never gonna
catch my breath

457
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,680
Say good-bye
to those who knew me

458
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Boy, was I a fool
in school for cutting gym

459
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
This guy's got 'em scared to death

460
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,760
Hope he doesn't see right through me

461
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Now I really wish
that I knew how to swim

462
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,120
- Be a man
- We must be swift as a coursing river

463
00:37:56,155 --> 00:38:00,657
- Be a man
- With all the force of a great typhoon

464
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:05,160
- Be a man
- With all the strength of a raging fire

465
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:12,200
Mysterious as the dark side
of the moon

466
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,360
Time is racing toward us

467
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Till the Huns arrive

468
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,960
Heed my every order

469
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,760
And you might survive

470
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,960
You're unsuited for
the rage of war

471
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,800
So pack up, go home
You're through

472
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,560
How could I
make a man

473
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,880
Out of you

474
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,640
- Be a man
- We must be swift as a coursing river

475
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,960
- Be a man
- With all the force of a great typhoon

476
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,360
- Be a man
- With all the strength of a raging fire

477
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:00,360
Mysterious as the dark side

478
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,240
Of the moon

479
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,120
- Be a man
- We must be swift as a coursing river

480
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,440
- Be a man
- With all the force of a great typhoon

481
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,720
- Be a man With all the
strength of a raging fire

482
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Mysterious as the dark side

483
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,640
Of the moon

484
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,960
Hoo-ah!

485
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,325
What do you see?

486
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,880
Black pine,
from the high mountains.

487
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

488
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Sulphur, from cannons.

489
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,480
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass...

490
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,760
where the Imperial Army
is waiting for us.

491
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,000
We can avoid them easily.

492
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,325
No.

493
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,560
The quickest way to the Emperor
is through that pass.

494
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,280
And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

495
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,480
We should return it to her.

496
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,360
No, this is not a good
idea. What if somebody sees you?

497
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,440
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

498
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,720
So a couple of guys don't rinse
out their socks. Picky, picky, picky.

499
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,360
Well, myself, I kind of
like that corn chip smell.

500
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,280
Ahhh.

501
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,720
Okay, all right. That's enough. Get
out before you get all pruny and stuff.

502
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,880
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

503
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah, yeah. "Stand watch, Mushu,

504
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,200
while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits. "

505
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,760
Pfft! Hygiene!

506
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,845
Me first! Me first!

507
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,440
We're doomed! There are a couple of
things I know they're bound to notice!

508
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,640
Whooo-ooo!

509
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,080
Hey, Ping!

510
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,120
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

511
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,480
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,
and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

512
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,480
Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before,

513
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,880
so let's start over.

514
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,880
Hi. I'm Ling.

515
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,360
- And I'm Chien-Po.
- Hello, Chien-Po.

516
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:49,200
And I am Yao!

517
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,440
King of the rock!

518
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,760
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

519
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,280
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think Ping and I can take you.

520
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,680
- I really don't wanna take him anywhere.
- Ping, we have to fight!

521
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,880
No, we don't. Uh, we, uh, could just
close our eyes and swim around.

522
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,880
Come on. Don't be
such a gir-

523
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:10,760
Ouch! Something bit me!

524
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,360
What a nasty flavor.

525
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:16,480
Snake!

526
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
Oooh, snake! Snake!

527
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,000
Snake! Snake!

528
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,360
Some king of the rock.
Aaah!

529
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
Boy, that was close.

530
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,960
No. That was vile.

531
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,360
You owe me big.

532
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,360
I never want to see
a naked man again.

533
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,880
- Hey, don't look at me.
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

534
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,880
You think your troops
are ready to fight?

535
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,240
Ha! They would not last a minute
against the Huns!

536
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,360
- They completed their training.
- Those boys...

537
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,120
are no more fit to be soldiers
than you are to be captain.

538
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,760
Once the General
reads my report,

539
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,360
your troops
will never see battle.

540
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,880
Oh, no, you don't! I've worked
too hard to get Mulan into this war.

541
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,760
This guy's messin'
with my plan.

542
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:13,800
We're not finished!

543
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,720
Be careful, Captain.
The General may be your father,

544
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,800
but I am
the Emperor's counsel.

545
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,640
And, oh, by the way, I got that job on my own.

546
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,240
You're dismissed.

547
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,760
Hey. I'll hold him
and you punch.

548
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,360
Or not.

549
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,720
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

550
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,000
- I saw that.
- What?

551
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,400
You like him, don't you?

552
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,560
- No!
- Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure. Go to your tent!

553
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,160
I think it's time we took
this war into our own hands.

554
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,000
Let me see what you got. "From General Li.
Dear Son, we're waiting for Huns at the Pass.

555
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,240
It would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up. "

556
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,880
That's great, except you forgot,
"And since we're out of potpourri,

557
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,080
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing up some. "

558
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,960
Hello! This is the army! Make it sound
more urgent! Know what I'm talkin' about?

559
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

560
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,360
Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.

561
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,120
Insubordinate ruffians!

562
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,840
You men owe me a new pair of slippers!

563
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,600
And I do not squeal like a girl.

564
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,480
Urgent news
from the General.

565
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,080
What's the matter? You've never seen
a black and white before?

566
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,440
Who are you?

567
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,160
Excuse me? I think
the question is, who are you?

568
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,120
We're in a war, man!
There's no time for stupid questions!

569
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,520
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

570
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,320
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

571
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,600
Captain, urgent news from the General!
We're needed at the front.

572
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,160
- Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

573
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,960
For a long time we've been marching
off to battle

574
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,920
- In our thundering herd
we feel a lot like cattle

575
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
Like a pounding beat
our aching feet

576
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,160
Aren't easy to ignore

577
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,160
Hey!
Think of instead

578
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,840
A girl
worth fighting for

579
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,320
- Huh?
- That's what I said.

580
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,280
A girl
worth fighting for

581
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,480
I want her paler
than the moon

582
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,600
With eyes that shine
like stars

583
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,640
My girl will marvel at my strength

584
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,240
Adore my battle scars

585
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,120
I couldn't care less what she'll wear
or what she looks like

586
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,320
It all depends on
what she cooks like

587
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,360
Beef, pork, chicken
Mmm

588
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,400
Bet the local girls thought you
were quite the charmer

589
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,920
And I'll bet the ladies
love a man in armor

590
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,480
You can guess what
we have missed the most

591
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,880
Since we went off to war

592
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,240
- What do we want
- A girl worth fighting for

593
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,440
My girl will think
I have no faults

594
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,920
That I'm a major find

595
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Uh, how 'bout a girl
who's got a brain

596
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,760
- Who always speaks her mind
- Nah!

597
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,440
My manly ways
and turn of phrase

598
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,880
Are sure to thrill her

599
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,840
He thinks he's
such a lady killer

600
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,000
I've a girl back home
who's unlike any other

601
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,480
Yeah, the only girl
who'd love him is his mother

602
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,720
But when we come home in victory

603
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,560
They'll line up
at the door

604
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,560
- What do we want
- A girl worth fighting for

605
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,640
- Wish that I had
- A girl worth fighting for

606
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,040
A girl worth fighting

607
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,400
Search for survivors.

608
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,280
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

609
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,200
Captain!

610
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,240
The General.

611
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,680
I'm sorry.

612
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,360
The Huns are moving quickly.

613
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,000
We'll make better time to the Imperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass.

614
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,800
We're the only hope
for the Emperor now.

615
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,760
Move out!

616
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,960
What happened?

617
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,580
- Um- - You just gave away
our position! Now we're-

618
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:07,160
- Um- - You just gave away
our position! Now we're-

619
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,280
Get out of range!

620
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,240
Aah!

621
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,880
Save the cannons!

622
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,040
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!

623
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
Hey!

624
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,360
Oh, sure.
Save the horse.

625
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,640
Fire!

626
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,880
Fire!

627
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
Hold the last cannon.

628
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,200
Prepare to fight.
If we die, we die with honor.

629
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,120
Yao, aim the cannon
at Shan-Yu.

630
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,240
- Hey!
- Ping! Come back!

631
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:21,880
Ping!

632
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,800
Stop!

633
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,040
All right. You might want to
light that right about now.

634
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,480
Quickly. Quickly!

635
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,960
Come on!
We gotta help!

636
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,040
- You missed!
How could you miss?

637
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,960
It was three feet
in front of you!

638
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,880
Whoa-ho-ho!

639
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,920
Mulan!

640
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,520
Mulan!

641
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,280
Mulan?

642
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,200
No.

643
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,640
Mulan!

644
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,760
Man, you are
one lucky bug.

645
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,160
Shang!

646
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,600
- Do you see them?
- Yes.

647
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,640
Perfect.
Now we'll pull them to safe-ty.

648
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,800
Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!

649
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,880
We need help.

650
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,280
Ooh, nice. Very nice.
You can sit by me.

651
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,000
- Aah!
- We're gonna die!

652
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,920
We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.

653
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,880
No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

654
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,080
I let them slip through my fingers.

655
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,760
Aah!

656
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,520
Pull!

657
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,920
Whoa!

658
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,920
Huh?

659
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,240
I knew we could do it.
You the man!

660
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,440
Well, sort of.

661
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,480
Step back, guys.
Give him some air.

662
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,320
Ping?

663
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,280
You are the craziest man I've ever met.

664
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,000
And for that,
I owe you my life.

665
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,400
From now on,
you have my trust.

666
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,080
Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!

667
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,600
- You're king of the mountain!
- Yes, yes, yes!

668
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,120
Ping! What's wrong?

669
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,360
He's wounded!
Get help!

670
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,200
Ping, hold on.

671
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,120
Hold on.

672
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,600
I can explain.

673
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,120
So it's true!

674
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,360
Shang!

675
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,240
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

676
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,600
A woman!

677
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,560
Treacherous snake!

678
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,040
My name is Mulan.

679
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,520
I did it
to save my father.

680
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,400
- High treason!
- I didn't mean for it to go this far.

681
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,640
Ultimate dishonor!

682
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,240
It was the only way.
Please believe me.

683
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,440
Captain?

684
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,280
Restrain him!

685
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,320
- No!
- You know the law.

686
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,440
A life for a life.

687
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,680
My debt is repaid.

688
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,840
- Move out!
- But you can't just-

689
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,720
I said, "Move out. "

690
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,920
I was this close.

691
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
This close
to impressin' the ancestors,

692
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,760
gettin' the top shelf,
an entourage.

693
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,360
Man. All my fine work.
Pfft.

694
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,880
Hi.

695
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,840
I should never have left home.

696
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,080
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.

697
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,560
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him
and disgracing your ancestors...

698
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,280
and losin' all your friends?

699
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
You know, you just gotta-
You gotta learn to let these things go.

700
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,520
Maybe I didn't go
for my father.

701
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,120
Maybe what I really wanted was to prove
I could do things right...

702
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,400
so when I looked in the mirror,

703
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,960
I'd see someone worthwhile.

704
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,000
But I was wrong.

705
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,480
I see nothing.

706
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,080
Now, that's just 'cause
this needs a little spit, that's all.

707
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,480
Let me shine this up for ya.

708
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,560
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

709
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,760
The truth is,
we're both frauds.

710
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

711
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,200
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

712
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,480
I risked your life
to help myself.

713
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,320
At least
you had good intentions.

714
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,520
What? What do you mean,
"You're not lucky"?

715
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,720
You lied to me?

716
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,880
And what are you, a sheep?

717
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,880
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

718
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,280
Let's go home.

719
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,400
Yeah. This ain't
gonna be pretty.

720
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,200
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

721
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,160
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

722
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,680
I promise.

723
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,040
Uh, home is that way.

724
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,200
- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

725
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,160
They popped out of the snow...
like daisies!

726
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Are we in this together
or not?

727
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,960
Well, let's go kick
some Hunny buns!

728
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,880
Yee-haw!

729
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,960
Make way for the heroes
of China.

730
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,040
- Shang!
- Mulan?

731
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,400
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

732
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,040
You don't belong here,
Mulan. Go home.

733
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,520
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

734
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,040
Why should I?

735
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,040
Why else would I come back?

736
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,720
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

737
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,200
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

738
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,160
Now, where are you going?

739
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,720
To find someone
who will believe me.

740
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,120
My children,
heaven smiles down...

741
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
upon the Middle Kingdom.

742
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,840
China will sleep
safely tonight...

743
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,600
thanks to
our brave warriors.

744
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,880
Sir, the Emperor's in danger.

745
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,000
But the Huns are here.

746
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,840
Please, you have to help.

747
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,960
- No one will listen.
- Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say something?

748
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,840
- Mushu.
- Hey, you're a girl again, remember?

749
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:48,160
Your Majesty, I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

750
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,520
I know what this means
to you, Captain Li.

751
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,080
Your father would have been
very proud.

752
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,880
- No!
- Come on!

753
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,880
They'll never reach
the Emperor in time.

754
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,840
Hey, guys!

755
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,240
I've got an idea.

756
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,400
Be a man

757
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,520
- We must be swift as a coursing river
- Be a man

758
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,920
- With all the force of a great typhoon
- Be a man

759
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,520
With all the strength
of a raging fire

760
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,120
Mysterious as the dark side
of the moon

761
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,800
Boo.

762
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,200
Guard the door.

763
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,120
Your walls and armies have fallen,
and now it's your turn.

764
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,080
Bow to me.

765
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,200
Okay. Any questions?

766
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,240
Does this dress
make me look fat?

767
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,080
Ow!

768
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,360
Who's there?

769
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,240
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.

770
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,720
Oh, he's so cute!

771
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,560
Ohh.

772
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,800
- Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

773
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,680
Shang, go!

774
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,720
I tire of your arrogance,
old man. Bow to me!

775
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:56,320
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

776
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,880
Then you will kneel
in pieces!

777
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,040
Chien-Po, get the Emperor!

778
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:16,680
Sorry, Your Majesty.

779
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,520
No!

780
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,400
Come on!

781
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,040
No.

782
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,480
You!

783
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,400
- You took away my victory!
- No!

784
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,920
I did.

785
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,240
The soldier
from the mountains.

786
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,005
So what's the plan?

787
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,240
- Um-
- You don't have a plan?

788
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,360
Hey, I'm making this up
as I... go.

789
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:34,400
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

790
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,720
Come on, Cri-Kee.

791
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,960
- Citizens, I need firepower.
- Who are you?

792
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,440
Your worst nightmare.

793
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,680
- On the roof!
- Look!

794
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,120
It looks like
you're out of ideas.

795
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,480
Not quite.

796
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,560
Ready, Mushu?

797
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,040
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

798
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,680
Huh?

799
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,040
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.

800
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,400
You are a lucky bug.

801
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,600
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

802
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,080
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

803
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,560
What a mess!
Stand aside!

804
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,440
That creature's
not worth protecting.

805
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,400
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

806
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,560
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous-

807
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,880
That is enough.

808
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,040
Your Majesty,
I can explain.

809
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,080
I've heard a great deal
about you, Fa Mulan.

810
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,600
You stole your father's armor,
ran away from home,

811
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,840
impersonated a soldier,

812
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,005
deceived
your commanding officer,

813
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,240
dishonored the Chinese Army,
destroyed my palace...

814
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,000
and...

815
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,040
you have saved us all.

816
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,040
Ah! Ooh!

817
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,440
My little baby is all grown up and-
and savin' China.

818
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,360
You have a tissue?

819
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,040
Chi Fu?

820
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,000
- Your Excellency?
- See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.

821
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,360
Member? What?

822
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,920
But... there are
no council positions open,

823
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,120
Your Majesty.

824
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,880
Very well.
You can have his job.

825
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,880
What? I-Oh.

826
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,720
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

827
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,520
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

828
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,800
Then... take this,

829
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,120
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

830
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,320
And this,

831
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,600
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

832
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,600
Is she allowed
to do that?

833
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,920
Um... you-

834
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,480
you fight good.

835
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,360
Ohh. Thank you.

836
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,040
Khan, let's go home.

837
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,120
The flower that blooms
in adversity...

838
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,720
is the most rare
and beautiful of all.

839
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,960
- Sir?
- You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.

840
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,920
Mulan!

841
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,600
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

842
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,560
And the crest
of the Emperor.

843
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,360
They're gifts
to honor the Fa family.

844
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:28,040
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

845
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:31,005
I've missed you so.

846
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,480
I've missed you too, Baba.

847
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,120
Great.

848
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,760
She brings home a sword. If you ask me,
she should've brought home a man.

849
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,000
Excuse me.
Does Fa Mulan live here?

850
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,600
Thank you.

851
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,000
Whoo! Sign me up
for the next war.

852
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,120
Honorable Fa Zhou, I-
Mulan!

853
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,320
Uh... you forgot
your helmet.

854
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,520
W- Well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?

855
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,520
- I mean-
- Would you like to stay for dinner?

856
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,240
Would you like
to stay forever?

857
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,800
Dinner would be great.

858
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,560
Come on.
Who did a good job?

859
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,840
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

860
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,360
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

861
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,120
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

862
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,320
Take it, Cri-Kee!

863
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,520
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

864
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,080
Call out for egg rolls!

865
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,720
Guardians.

866
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,720
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.

867
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,440
Mushu!

868
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,320
Whenever you feel your world
is crashin' down on you

869
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,320
Whenever you don't know
where to turn or what to do

870
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,800
Don't look too far

871
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,760
You've got the guide

872
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,760
To find your way

873
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,400
Let your heart decide

874
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,200
Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

875
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,240
. That's when
the heavens will part

876
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,160
. And show the world
what you believe in

877
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,840
. Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

878
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,000
. And when you're true
to your heart

879
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,880
. Then you've got all you need
to make it through

880
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,120
. Be true to your heart

881
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,440
. Ah, someone you know
is on your side

882
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,680
. Can set you free

883
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,720
. I can do that for you
if you believe in me

884
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,160
. Why second guess

885
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,120
. What feels so right

886
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,080
. Just trust your heart

887
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,920
. And you'll see the light

888
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,600
. Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

889
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,640
. That's when
the heavens will part

890
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,600
. And show the world
what you believe in

891
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,120
. Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

892
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,320
And when you're true
to your heart

893
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,440
Then you've got all you need
to make it through

894
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,480
You know it's true

895
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,920
It'll see you through
Yeah, yeah, yeah

896
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,600
- You've got to be true
- Baby

897
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,520
Be true to your heart

898
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,200
Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

899
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,400
That's when
the heavens will part

900
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,320
And show the world
what you believe in

901
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,960
Open your eyes
Your heart will tell you no lies

902
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,040
And when you're true
to your heart

903
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,200
Then you've got all you need
to make it through

904
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,880
Be true

905
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,160
To your heart

906
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,125
Sing the chorus, boys.

907
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,280
When things
are gettin' crazy

908
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,520
And you don't know
where to start

909
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Keep on believin', baby

910
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,880
Just be true
to your heart

911
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,000
- When all the world around you
- Yeah

912
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,160
It seems to fall apart

913
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,280
Keep on believin', baby

914
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,480
- Just be true to your heart
- True to your heart

915
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,920
Just be true

916
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,080
To your heart

917
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,240
Got to be true

918
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,040
Be true
True, true, true, true

919
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,960
To your heart

920
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,560
Look at me

921
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:54,400
You may think you see
who I really am

922
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,880
But you'll never know me

923
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,160
Every day

924
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:04,160
It's as if
I play a part

925
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,240
Now I see

926
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,200
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world

927
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,640
But I cannot fool my heart

928
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,440
Who is that girl I see

929
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,080
Staring straight
back at me

930
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:33,600
When will my reflection show

931
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:38,920
Who I am inside

932
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,240
I am now

933
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,240
In a world where
I have to hide my heart

934
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,720
And what I believe in

935
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
But somehow

936
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,240
I will show the world

937
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,760
What's inside my heart

938
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:01,040
And be loved for who I am

939
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:09,080
Who is that girl I see

940
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:13,720
Staring straight back at me

941
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,520
Why is my reflection

942
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,160
Someone I don't know

943
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,400
Must I pretend that I'm

944
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,880
Someone else for all time

945
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,880
When will my reflection show

946
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,840
Who I am

947
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,880
Inside, there's a heart

948
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,320
That must be free

949
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,120
To fly

950
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,200
And I burn

951
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,120
With a need to know

952
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:59,440
The reason why

953
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:04,400
Why must we all conceal

954
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,720
What we think
How we feel

955
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,280
Must there be a secret me

956
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,160
I'm forced to hide

957
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:23,400
I won't pretend that I'm

958
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,960
Someone else for all time

959
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,040
When will my reflection show

960
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:38,280
Who I am inside

961
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,600
When will my reflection show

962
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,600
Who I am inside

963
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,000
Oh, hey, yeah

964
01:23:57,305 --> 01:24:57,408
