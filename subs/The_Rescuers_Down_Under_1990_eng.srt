00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,743
Passengers, please remain seated

347
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,495
until the aircraft comes to
a full and complete stop.

348
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,669
Thank you.

349
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,380
Whoa!

350
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,765
Quick, Sparky, we need
to make a drag line!

351
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,521
Don't try and tell me
the runway's too short.

352
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,150
Hold this for me, will you, pal?

353
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,696
Bloke ought to have
his wings clipped.

354
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,824
Captain thanks you for
flying Albatross Airlines...

355
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,159
Crazy Yanks.

356
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,834

thing without regard for...

358
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,092
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.

359
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,813
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant,

360
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,722
don't hesitate to ask.

361
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,142
- Oh, how kind.
- Allow me to get that bag for you.

362
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:39,438
(CLEARS THROAT)
I've got a lot of luggage here.

363
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,315
Let me give you a hand with those.

364
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,609
Part of the friendly
service at Albatross...

365
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,028
- (BACK CRACKS)
- Ow! Big time hurt!

366
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,488
Back! It's out!

367
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,574
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.

368
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,994
Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta
get this bird to the hospital.

369
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,999
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!

370
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,838
- MICE: Heave! Ho!
- WILBUR: What are you doing?

371
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,091
What's going on? Wait!

372
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,178
- Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
- MISS BIANCA: Wilbur, don't worry.

373
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,848
We'll come back the
moment we find the boy.

374
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,101
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!

375
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:21,355
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.

376
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,233
I'm even ready to mambo. (HUMMING)

377
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,026
- (BACK CRACKS)
- Ow!

378
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,154
Doctor, will he be all right?

379
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:31,323
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.

380
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,411
They all come in with a whimper,
and leave with a grin.

381
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:40,042
Off with you now. Leave everything
to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.

382
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,377
Hop to it, ladies. We've got
a bent bird on our hands.

383
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,047
- Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
- Will it hurt, Doc?

384
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,633
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.

385
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,928
- Launch the back brace!
- WILBUR: Hey, wait!

386
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,849
(SCREAMS) I've been skewered!

387
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,059
I've already missed
tea, Mr. Albatross.

388
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,105
Now don't force me to take
drastic measures. You must relax.

389
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,275
Relax? I have never been
more relaxed in my life!

390
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,404
If I were any more
relaxed, I'd be dead!

391
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,364
I'm not convinced.

392
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,991
60 milligrams!

393
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,202
60 milligrams.

394
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,920
WILBUR: Hey! What?

395
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,789
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!

396
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm an American citizen, buddy!

397
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,919
- Better double it!
- Double?

398
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,296
- Double, coming up!
- WILBUR: No!

399
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,590
Prepare the albatross for medication.

400
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,385
I'm dreaming! Come on,
Wilbur. Wake up, boy!

401
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,054
- DOCTOR: Three degrees right.
- Come on!

402
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,765
- Three degrees right.
- Down two degrees.

403
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,099
Don't go down two!

404
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,768
- Down two degrees.
- Ready!

405
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,770
No, I'm not ready! No, please!

406
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,272
Aim!

407
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,732
Please don't do this to me.

408
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,816
DOCTOR: Fire!

409
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,236
- (GUNSHOT)
- WILBUR: Ow!

410
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,864
Oh! Oh! (MOANING)

411
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,158
Now we just gotta figure
out how to get there.

412
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,955
So are you and your husband here
on a little outback excursion?

413
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,458
No, we're not married.

414
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,462
In fact, we're here on
a top secret mission.

415
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,590
Very hush-hush.

416
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,925
Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed?

417
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,636
Why, that's right! How did you know?

418
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,431
You'll find it's tough to keep
secrets in the outback, miss.

419
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,059
So which way you taking?

420
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,604
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?

421
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,065
- "Suicide Trail"?
- Good choice.

422
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,484
More snakes, less quicksand.

423
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:35,030
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek,
you're scot-free, that is until...

424
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,407
<i>Dead Dingo Pass.</i>

425
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,911
Wait a minute, I don't see
any of that stuff on the map.

426
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,163
A map's no good in the outback!

427
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:47,835
What you really need is someone
who knows the territory.

428
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,504
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?

429
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,506
At your service!

430
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,176
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.

431
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,347
I remember the time it was just
me and 400 of these big, giant...

432
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,852
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.

433
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,494
This is how we get around
in the outback, Miss B.

434
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,404
The only way to travel, Berno.

435
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,455
Yeah, it's just a
little bumpy back here.

436
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,548
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.

437
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,725

439
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,077
Well, boy, let's see
if we can do something

440
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:07,208
to refresh that rusty,
old memory of yours.

441
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,087
Is she on Satan's Ridge?

442
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,882
Or Nightmare Canyon?

443
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,430
What do you think?

444
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,554
- (GROWLS)
- Yeah, that's it.

445
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,777
Right smack dab in the
middle at Croc Falls!

446
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,022
- Am I getting warm?
- I told you, I don't remember.

447
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,778
Don't you realize a bird that
size is worth a fortune?

448
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,280
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.

449
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:44,159
You won't have any money after
the rangers get through with you.

453
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,471
Been gone a long time.

454
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,974
Maybe I should go... Oh!

455
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,309
Maybe I should go look for him.

456
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,188
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.

457
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,773
Yeah, I noticed.

458
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,743
I am just sure he'll
be back in no time.

459
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,997
You know, now that
we're alone, there's...

460
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,542
There's something that I've
been wanting to ask you.

461
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,586
Yes? What is it?

462
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,006
Well, it's like this.

463
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:44,104

464
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,221

465
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,599

There!

470
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,862
I've been looking all over for you.

471
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,864
Now look.

472
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,451
We got a long way to go,
and you're gonna take us there.

473
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,580
You're not gonna give us
any trouble about it.

474
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,298
Right?

475
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,337
They're harmless once you look them
in the eye, let them know who's boss.

476
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,215
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.

477
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:26,053
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.

478
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,103
Yeah, I noticed.

479
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:35,145
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.

480
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,190
There was this one time,
it was just me and 300

481
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,776
of these ferocious,
mouse-eating dingoes.

Miss Bianca, before
anything else happens,
