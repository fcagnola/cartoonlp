00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:39,965
<i>Many strange legends</i>
<i>are told of these jungles of India,</i>

3
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:44,606
<i>but none so strange as the story</i>
<i>of a small boy named Mowgli.</i>

4
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:49,933
<i>It all began when the silence</i>
<i>of the jungle was broken</i>

5
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:51,414
<i>by an unfamiliar sound.</i>

6
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,333
<i>It was a sound like</i>
<i>one never heard before</i>

7
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:01,212
<i>in this part of the jungle.</i>

8
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:09,567
<i>It was a man cub!</i>

9
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,374
<i>Had I known how deeply</i>
<i>I was to be involved,</i>

10
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:15,253
<i>I would've obeyed</i>
<i>my first impulse and walked away.</i>

11
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:29,247
<i>This man cub would have</i>
<i>to have nourishment, and soon.</i>

12
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:32,054
<i>It was many days' travel</i>
<i>to the nearest man-village,</i>

13
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,854
<i>and without a mother's care,</i>
<i>he would soon perish.</i>

14
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,324
<i>Then it occurred to me.</i>

15
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:40,486
<i>A family of wolves I knew</i>

16
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:43,135
<i>had been blessed</i>
<i>with a litter of cubs.</i>

17
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,884
<i>I knew there'd be no problem</i>
<i>with the mother,</i>

18
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,693
<i>thanks to the maternal instinct,</i>

19
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:50,814
<i>but I wasn't so sure</i>
<i>about Rama, the father.</i>

20
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:24,327
<i>Ten times, the rains</i>
<i>had come and gone,</i>

21
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:28,203
<i>and I often stopped by to see how</i>
<i>Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.</i>

22
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,207
<i>He was a favourite with all</i>
<i>the young wolf cubs of the pack.</i>

23
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:49,124
<i>No man cub was ever happier.</i>

24
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,844
<i>And yet, I knew that someday</i>

25
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,927
<i>he would have to go back</i>
<i>to his own kind.</i>

26
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:04,169
<i>Then one night, the wolf pack</i>
<i>elders met at Council Rock</i>

27
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,928
<i>because Shere Khan, the tiger,</i>

28
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:10,007
<i>had returned</i>
<i>to their part of the jungle.</i>

29
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:14,247
<i>This meeting was to change</i>
<i>the man cub's entire future.</i>

30
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:18,726
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

31
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:23,491
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

32
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:28,364
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.

33
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,253
Rama. Come over here, please.

34
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,451
Yes, Akela?

35
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,526
The council
has reached its decision.

36
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,846
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

37
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:40,334
He must leave at once.

38
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,053
"Leave"?

39
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,571
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

40
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,374
But the man cub is...

41
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,252
Well, he's like my own son.

42
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:53,133
Surely he's entitled
to the protection of the pack.

43
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:55,570
But, Rama, even the strength
of the pack

44
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:57,611
is no match for the tiger.

45
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:01,085
But the boy cannot
survive alone in the jungle.

46
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,814
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.

47
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:07,328
You, Bagheera? How?

48
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,532
I know of a man-village
where he'll be safe.

49
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:14,085
Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.

50
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,131
I'm sure he'll go with me.

51
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:19,013
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.

52
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,373
Good luck.

53
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,654
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.

54
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,293
Shouldn't we start back home?

55
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,084
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

56
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:47,891
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?

57
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:52,253
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle...

58
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,567
...and he has sworn to kill you.

59
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,123
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?

60
00:07:57,735 --> 00:07:59,771
He hates man.

61
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,643
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,

62
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,487
just another hunter with a gun.

63
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:09,488
We'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.

64
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:13,204
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

65
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,412
Well, maybe so,
but I'm not afraid.

66
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,407
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.

67
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,928
We'll spend the night here.

68
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,085
Things will look better
in the morning.

69
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,450
Man Cub?

70
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,973
Man Cub!

71
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:32,171
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.

72
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,214
I don't wanna go back
to the man-village.

73
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,933
Go on. Up you go.

74
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,649
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

75
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,813
Is that all the better you can climb?

76
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,810
It's too big around.

77
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,967
And besides, I don't have any claws.

78
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,974
Now get some sleep.

79
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,933
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

80
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,131
I wanna stay in the jungle.

81
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:21,491
Huh? You wouldn't last one day.

82
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,967
I'm not afraid.

83
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,046
I can look out for myself.

84
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,169
S-S-S-Say, now.

85
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,723
What have we here?

86
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,932
It's a man cub.

87
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:49,290
A delic-i-ous man cub.

88
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,411
Oh, go away and leave me alone.

89
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,249
Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.

90
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:59,764
Oh, now, please
go to sleep, Man Cub.

91
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,764
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.

92
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:07,086
<i>Pleas-s-se go to sleep</i>

93
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,053
<i>Please go to sleep</i>

94
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,252
<i>S- S-Sleep, little man cub</i>

95
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:16,008
<i>Rest in peace</i>

96
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,525
Sleep.

97
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:25,527
S-S-S-Sleep.

98
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,765
Bagheera...

99
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,846
Oh, now... now, look,
there's no use arguing anymore.

100
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,453
Now, no more talk till morning.

101
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,652
He won't be here in the morning.

102
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:42,886
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...

103
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,091
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!

104
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,846
My sinus-s-s-s-s.

105
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:56,405
You have just made
a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend,

106
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:59,532
a very s-s-s-stupid...

107
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,207
Now, Kaa, I was...

108
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,331
...mistake.

109
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,849
Look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you.

110
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,493
No, please, Kaa...

111
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,009
Both eyes, if you please.

112
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,095
You have just

113
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,565
s-s-s-sealed your doom.

114
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:25,207
Look, Bagheera.

115
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,253
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.

116
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,206
Wha...?

117
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:36,607
Just you wait
till I get you in my coils.

118
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:41,325
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!

119
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,053
"He's got a knot in his tail."

120
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:52,045
This is going to slow down

121
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,444
my s-s-s-slithering.

122
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:02,130
So, you can look out
for yourself, can you?

123
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:04,331
So, you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?

124
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:07,373
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.

125
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:11,209
Now, now, for the last time,
go to sleep.

126
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:15,248
Man cub.

127
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,651
Man cub.

128
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,251
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

129
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,849
<i>Keep it up</i>
<i>Two, three, four</i>

130
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,926
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

131
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,085
<i>Keep it up two, three, four</i>

132
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:57,167
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

133
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,052
A parade!

134
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,685
Oh, no.

135
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:04,164
The dawn patrol again.

136
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,449
Company... sound off!

137
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:13,605
<i>Oh, the aim of our patrol</i>

138
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:16,163
<i>Is a question rather droll</i>

139
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,405
<i>For to march and drill</i>
<i>over field and hill</i>

140
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:23,449
<i>Is a military goal</i>

141
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,003
<i>Is a military goal</i>

142
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,245
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

143
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,485
<i>Dress it up, two, three, four</i>

144
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,725
<i>By the ranks or single file</i>

145
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,283
<i>Over every jungle mile</i>

146
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,935
<i>Oh, we stamp and crush</i>
<i>through the underbrush</i>

147
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:43,166
<i>In the military style</i>

148
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,564
<i>In the military style</i>

149
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,168
Hello. What are you doing?

150
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:49,291
Drilling.

151
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,845
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

152
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:57,087
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.

153
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:04,446
To the rear... march!

154
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:09,130
The other way. Turn around.

155
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,285
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

156
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,128
<i>Keep it up, two, three, four</i>

157
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:16,251
To the rear...

158
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,246
...ho!

159
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,490
Company... halt!

160
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,847
That means "stop."

161
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,889
Company... left face!

162
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,288
March, march, march.

163
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,445
My feet are killing me.

164
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:39,003
I'm puttin' in for a transfer
to another herd.

165
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,687
Silence in the ranks!

166
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:50,285
Dress up that line.

167
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,128
Pull it in, Winifred.

168
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,728
Inspection...

169
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,168
...arms!

170
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,524
Stick your nose out.

171
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,810
- Like this?
- That's right.

172
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,973
A dusty muzzle.

173
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:13,889
Soldier, remember: In battle,
that trunk can save your life.

174
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,886
Take good care of it, my man.

175
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,614
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.

176
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,245
Let's have a little more spit and polish
on those bayonets.

177
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,370
Yes, sir.

178
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:29,570
Esprit de corps.

179
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,566
That's the way I earned my commission

180
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,044
in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.

181
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,693
Back in '88, it was...
Or was it?

182
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,529
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.

183
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,812
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross,

184
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,363
for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty.

185
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,492
Those were the days.

186
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,294
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.

187
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,048
Builds character and that
sort of thing, you know.

188
00:15:57,575 --> 00:16:00,043
Oh.

189
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:02,330
Where was I?

190
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,645
Oh, yes. Inspection.

191
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,532
Well, very good.

192
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,368
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

193
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:16,684
Eyes front.

194
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:21,251
Lieutenant, that haircut
is not regulation.

195
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:23,565
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?

196
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,452
There. That's better.

197
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:29,251
And as for you...

198
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,371
Oh, there you are.

199
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:36,567
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?

200
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,407
OK, Pop.

201
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,009
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.

202
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,848
Well, a new recruit, eh?

203
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:48,334
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!

204
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:50,406
Stop that!

205
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:54,568
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!

206
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,850
I'll have no man cub
in my jungle!

207
00:16:56,935 --> 00:17:00,245
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!

208
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,212
I can explain, Hathi.

209
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:05,093
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.

210
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,735
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.

211
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:12,331
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.

212
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,691
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

213
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,527
Good.

214
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:21,244
And remember,
an elephant never forgets.

215
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:26,445
I don't know what the army's
coming to these days.

216
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:29,766
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?

217
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,323
Let's get on with it!

218
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,167
Right face!

219
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,371
Forward... march!

220
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:47,284
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?

221
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,286
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.

222
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,525
An elephant never forgets.

223
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,369
Well, you just forgot our son.

224
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,094
Our... Son? Son!

225
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,325
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.

226
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,610
To the rear... march!

227
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:10,490
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...

228
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,931
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

229
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,927
Pop! Look out!

230
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,730
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."

231
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:36,407
He said an elephant never forgets.

232
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,811
It's not funny.

233
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:45,570
Let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.

234
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,168
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?

235
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:56,411
You're going back
to the man-village right now.

236
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,486
I'm not going.

237
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:02,045
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.

238
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:05,889
You're going, if I have to
drag you every step of the way.

239
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:09,411
Let go, you...

240
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,646
You let go of me!

241
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,012
Oh, that does it.

242
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,211
I've had it, Man Cub.

243
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:28,446
From now on,
you're on your own...

244
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,967
...alone!

245
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,488
Don't worry about me.

246
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:04,609
Foolish man cub.

247
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:35,248
<i>Doo-bee, doo-bee</i>
<i>Doo-bee-dee-doo</i>

248
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,326
<i>Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo</i>

249
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,371
<i>Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo</i>

250
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:42,253
<i>I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee</i>
<i>Doo-bee, doo-bee</i>

251
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,166
<i>Doo-bee-dee-doo</i>

252
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,052
<i>And with...</i>

253
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,891
Well, now.

254
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,772
What have we here?

255
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:56,894
Hey!

256
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,887
What a funny little bit of a...

257
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:01,852
- Ooh!
- Go away!

258
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:05,974
Oh, boy, I've seen
everything in these woods.

259
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,534
Ooh, what have I run on?

260
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:10,812
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.

261
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,491
Well, now, that's pretty
big talk, little britches.

262
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,372
I'm big enough.

263
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,726
Pitiful.

264
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:24,251
Hey, kid, you need help

265
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,532
and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you
to fight like a bear.

266
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,733
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.

267
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,731
Yeah!

268
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,526
All right, now, kid, loosen up.

269
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:40,812
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.

270
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,489
That's it. Now give me
a big bear growl.

271
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:46,135
Scare me.

272
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,250
Oh, boy.

273
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:53,566
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.

274
00:21:58,495 --> 00:21:59,689
He's in trouble.

275
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,447
I shouldn't have left him alone.

276
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:11,053
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?

277
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:18,011
You're gettin' it, kid.

278
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:21,405
Oh, no! It's Baloo!

279
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:24,487
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.

280
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,294
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.

281
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,093
Keep movin'. Keep...

282
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:33,248
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on! That's it!

283
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,485
He's a dandy!

284
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:42,366
Fine teacher you are, Ol' Iron Paws.

285
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:44,525
Thanks, Bagheera.

286
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:48,369
Tell me, tell me, after you
knock your pupil senseless,

287
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:51,288
how do you expect him
to remember the lesson, hmm?

288
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,445
Well, I...

289
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:57,084
Well, I didn't mean
to lay it on him so hard.

290
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,928
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.

291
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:02,165
I'm a lot tougher
than some people think.

292
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,927
You better believe it.

293
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,414
Now, let's go once more.

294
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:08,771
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.

295
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,607
You'd better keep movin'...

296
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,255
Hey! Right on the button.

297
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,615
No. No, no. No, no. Now you're ticklin'.

298
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:24,446
No. No, no. No, no. Now you're ticklin'.

299
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,250
No. No, now, we don't do that
here in the jun... No!

300
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:33,168
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.

301
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:36,327
Help! Bagheera!

302
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,054
Oh, boy. That's all he needs,
more confidence.

303
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,774
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!

304
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,289
I give...

305
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,843
Hey!

306
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:49,574
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.

307
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:50,804
What do they call you?

308
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:54,331
Mowgli, and he's going back
to the man-village right now.

309
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:58,647
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.

310
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,454
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.

311
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:02,934
Certainly, you do.

312
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:07,406
Oh? And just how do you think
he will survive?

313
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:11,932
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...

314
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:15,325
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.

315
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:18,566
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.

316
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:23,648
Look, now, it's like this,
little britches.

317
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:26,533
All you gotta do is...

318
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:29,732
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

319
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,567
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

320
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:35,364
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

321
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,413
<i>I mean, the bare necessities</i>

322
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,247
<i>Are Mother Nature's recipes</i>

323
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:44,374
<i>That bring</i>
<i>the bare necessities of life</i>

324
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,730
<i>Wherever I wander</i>

325
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:48,851
<i>Wherever I roam</i>

326
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:51,165
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

327
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,052
<i>Of my big home</i>

328
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,729
<i>The bees are buzzin' in the tree</i>

329
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:58,454
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

330
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:00,765
<i>When you look under</i>
<i>the rocks and plants</i>

331
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,811
<i>And take a glance at the fancy ants</i>

332
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:04,772
<i>Then maybe try a few</i>

333
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:06,208
You eat ants?

334
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:08,047
Ha ha! You better believe it.

335
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:10,695
And you're gonna love
the way they tickle.

336
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,812
Mowgli, look out!

337
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,967
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>
<i>will come to you</i>

338
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:18,283
But when?

339
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,252
<i>They'll come to you</i>

340
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,008
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

341
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:25,370
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

342
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:29,164
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

343
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:32,008
<i>I mean, the bare necessities</i>

344
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,211
<i>That's why a bear can rest at ease</i>

345
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:37,367
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

346
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,246
<i>Now, when you pick a pawpaw</i>

347
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:42,690
<i>Or a prickly pear</i>

348
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,768
<i>And you prick a raw paw</i>
<i>Well, next time beware</i>

349
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:49,415
<i>Don't pick the prickly pear</i>
<i>by the paw</i>

350
00:25:49,495 --> 00:25:51,963
<i>When you pick a pear</i>
<i>try to use the claw</i>

351
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:54,523
<i>But you don't need</i>
<i>to use the claw</i>

352
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:56,845
<i>When you pick a pear</i>
<i>of the big pawpaw</i>

353
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:58,926
<i>Have I given you a clue?</i>

354
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,528
Golly, thanks, Baloo.

355
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:05,166
"Pawpaw." Of all the silly gibberish.

356
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:07,325
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.

357
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:10,612
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

358
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,892
- They'll come to me!
- <i>They'll come to you</i>

359
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:17,729
How 'bout scratchin' that left shoulder
while you're up there, Mowgli?

360
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:19,443
No. Just a hair lower.

361
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:22,971
There. Right there. That's it.

362
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:26,525
This is beautiful. That's good.

363
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:30,005
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.

364
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,450
You're lots of fun, Baloo.

365
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,575
Right on it.

366
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:36,929
Yeah!

367
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:39,974
That's delicious.

368
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:45,813
Just a little bit...

369
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,284
Yeah!

370
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:01,567
Yeah!

371
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:11,845
Oh, man. This is really livin'.

372
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:17,607
So just try and relax. Yeah.

373
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:19,564
Cool it.

374
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,374
Fall apart in my backyard.

375
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:25,333
'Cause let me tell you
somethin', little britches...

376
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:28,646
If you act like that bee...

377
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:31,169
You're workin' too hard.

378
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,646
And don't spend your time...

379
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:35,884
...lookin' around...

380
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,293
...for something you want...

381
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,684
...that can't be found.

382
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,845
<i>When you find out</i>
<i>you can live without it</i>

383
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,812
<i>And go along not thinkin' about it</i>

384
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:48,363
<i>I'll tell you somethin' true</i>

385
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:52,209
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

386
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,446
I give up.

387
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,332
Well, I hope his luck holds out.

388
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,975
Mowgli, how about you singin'?

389
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,888
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

390
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,091
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

391
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,564
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

392
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:11,728
- Yeah, man!
- <i>I mean, the bare necessities</i>

393
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,170
<i>That's why a bear</i>
<i>can rest at ease</i>

394
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:16,928
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

395
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,528
Yeah!

396
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,573
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

397
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:24,215
<i>Yeah, man</i>

398
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:28,208
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.

399
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,126
I like being a bear.

400
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:32,775
That's my boy.

401
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:35,210
You're gonna make one swell bear.

402
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,535
Why, you even sing like one.

403
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:40,843
Yeah.

404
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,568
<i>Doo-bee-doo</i>

405
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,452

<i>Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo</i>

407
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:58,290
Hey, Mowgli, how about you
flickin' that ol' mean fly

408
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,014
off of your papa bear's nose?

409
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:07,128
Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...

410
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:11,844
Why, you flat-nosed,
little-eyed, flaky creep!

411
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,613
Hey! Let go of me!

412
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:18,483
Take your flea-pickin' hands
off of my cub!

413
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,531
Come on and get 'im, champ!

414
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:23,175
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!

415
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:25,086
Yeah! A big hothead!

416
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:26,893
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...

417
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:30,288
That'll cool 'im off!

418
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,252
Gimme back my man cub!

419
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,405
Here he is! Come and get 'im!

420
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,091
That's how a bear can rest at ease!

421
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:42,086
Here's some bare necessities!

422
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,726
Now, just try that again, you...

423
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:52,205
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!

424
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:55,048
You turn him loose,
or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!

425
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:56,488
We give up!

426
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,167
Here he comes!

427
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:01,848
Baloo! Catch me!

428
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:04,403
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster!

429
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:05,928
Faster!

430
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:10,607
A rolling bear gathers no hair!

431
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:16,731
Baloo, help me!

432
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,409
Baloo! They're carrying me away!

433
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:22,052
Bagheera!

434
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:24,126
Bagheera!

435
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:26,012
Well, it's happened.

436
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:29,371
Took a little longer than I thought,
but it's happened.

437
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,970
Bagheera!

438
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:38,728
Bagheera!

439
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:40,328
Oh, you heard me, huh?

440
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:43,327
Mowgli. Mowgli!

441
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:45,804
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?

442
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,207
They ambushed me.

443
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,774
Thousands of 'em.

444
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:52,813
I jabbed with my left,
then I swung with a right...

445
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:57,366
Oh, for the last time,
what happened to Mowgli?

446
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,811
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys
carried him off!

447
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:02,851
The ancient ruins.

448
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:06,610
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen
when he meets that king of theirs.

449
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,486
<i>Dah dee-ding dah-ding-ding</i>

Here he is!
Man, we got him! We got him!

457
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:37,886
So, you're the man cub.

458
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,966
Crazy!

459
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:43,604
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!

460
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,246
You cut that out!

461
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:50,884
Cool it, boy. Unwind yourself.

462
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:57,012
Now, come on.
Let's shake... cousin.

463
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:58,847
What do you want me for?

464
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:02,166
Word has grabbed my royal ear...

465
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:04,211
Have a banana.

466
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:06,206
...that you wanna stay in the jungle.

467
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:09,173
"Stay in the jungle"? I sure do.

468
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:12,167
Good. And ol' King Louie...

469
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,724
That's me.

470
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,294
...can fix it for you.

471
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,887
Have two bananas.

472
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:23,803
Have we got a deal?

473
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes, sir, I'll do...
I'll do anything to stay in the jungle.

474
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,646
Well, then,

475
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:32,333
I'll lay it on the line for you.

00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:01,607
Gee, Cousin Louie,
you're doin' real good.

493
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:04,289
Now here's your part
of the deal, cuz.

494
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:08,325
Lay the secret on me
of man's red fire.

495
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,690
But I don't know how to make fire.

496
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:13,414
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, Man Cub</i>

497
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,213
<i>I made a deal with you</i>

00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,855

499
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,051
<i>To make my dream come true</i>

500
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,012
<i>Now give me the secret, Man Cub</i>

501
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:24,404
<i>Come on</i>
<i>Clue me what to do</i>

502
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,770
<i>Give me the power</i>
<i>of man's red flower</i>

503

<i>So I can be like you</i>

504
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,694
Fire? So that's
what that scoundrel's after.

505
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,335
I'll tear 'im limb from limb.

506
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:39,248
I'll beat 'im. I'll... I'll...

507
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,803
Yeah!

508
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,851
Well, man, what a beat.

509
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:46,654
Will you stop that silly
beat business and listen?

510
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:49,169
This will take brains, not brawn.

511
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,645
You better believe it,
and I'm loaded with both.

512
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:55,613
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.

513
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,528
Now, while you create a disturbance,

514
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:01,049
I'll rescue Mowgli.

515
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:03,285
- Got that?
- I'm gone, man.

516
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:07,004

00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:05,927
<i>Can learn to be like someone like me</i>

533
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,368
<i>Take me home, daddy</i>

534
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:10,970
<i>Can learn to be like someone like you</i>

535
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:12,568
- <i>One more time</i>
- Yeah!

536
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:16,807
<i>Can learn to be like someone like me</i>

537
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:25,925
- It's Baloo, the bear!
- Yeah, that's him!

538
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,607
How'd that square get in there?

539
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:29,447
Baloo! It's you!

540
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:42,566
Man, that's what I call
a swingin' party!

541
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,533
And furthermore, Baloo,

542
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:12,493
Mowgli seems to have man's ability
to get into trouble,

543
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:14,805
and your influence
hasn't been exactly...

544
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:18,729
Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.

545
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:21,329
Well, he's had a big day.

546
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,406
It was a real sockeroo.

547
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:26,293
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.

548
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,014
A disgraceful performance.

549
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:32,690
Associating with those
undesirable, scatterbrained apes?

550
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:35,926
I hope Mowgli learned
something from that experience.

551
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:42,568
<i>Scooby-dooby-dooby</i>
<i>Dooby-doo</i>

552
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:45,966
That's my boy.

553
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:49,255
Oh, nonsense.

554
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,013
Baloo.

555
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:07,133
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.

556
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:10,571
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?

557
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,889
All right, what's up, Bagheera?

558
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,613
Baloo,

559
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:22,847
the man cub must go back
to the man-village.

560
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:26,644
The jungle is not the place for him.

561
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:30,364
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.

562
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,923
Yes, just look at yourself.

563
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,733
Look at that eye.

564
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:36,809
Yeah.

565
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:39,685
It's beautiful, ain't it?

566
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:42,164
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.

567
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,294
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket of fruit yourself.

568
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:51,767
Baloo,

569
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:56,006
you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.

570
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,323
Why not?

571
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,686
How can I put it?

572
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:03,530
Baloo,

573
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:07,051
birds of a feather
should flock together.

574
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:09,205
You wouldn't marry a panther,
would you?

575
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:10,648
I don't know.

576
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:14,933
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.

577
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,005
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be
serious about this.

578
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:21,814
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.

579
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:23,487
I'll take care of him.

580
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:26,533
Yes, like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

581
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:29,732
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.

582
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,053
And another thing,

583
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:36,048
sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.

584
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,172
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?

585
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:43,691
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

586
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,608
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

587
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,448
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

588
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:52,368
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

589
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:56,004
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

590
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:57,767
Just one swipe and...

591
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:01,893
Well, what are we gonna do?

592
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,852
We'll do what's best for the boy.

593
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:06,495
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.

594
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:10,045
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man-village.

595
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,363
Are you out of your mind?

596
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:14,253
I promised him he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

597
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,007
That's just the point.

598
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:19,053
As long as he remains with you,
he's in danger.

599
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:21,603
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?

600
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:24,289
Because he won't listen to me.

601
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:27,814
I love that kid.

602
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,726
I love him like he was my own cub.

603
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:33,091
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

604
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:35,291
Well, can't...

605
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,047
Can't I wait until morning?

606
00:41:37,135 --> 00:41:38,807
It's morning now.

607
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:42,854
Go on, Baloo.

608
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:05,094
Oh, boy.

609
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,089
Mowgli. Mowgli.

610
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,924
It's time to get up.

611
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:16,405
Oh. Hi, Baloo.

612
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:17,974
Hi.

613
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:21,843
Hey, rub that ol' sleep
outta your eyes.

614
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:25,052
You and me, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

615
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:28,366
Swell. We'll have
lots of fun together.

616
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,248
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

617
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:35,611
All right, let's hit the trail, kid.

618
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:39,688
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.

619
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:41,811
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

620
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,489
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

621
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,372
Goodbye, Man Cub...

622
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:48,654
...and good luck.

623
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,293
Come on, Baloo.

624
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,172
All we gotta do is...

625
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:55,486
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

626
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:57,725
<i>Some good ol' bare necessities</i>

627
00:42:57,815 --> 00:43:01,251
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

628
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:03,485
<i>I mean, the bare necessities</i>

629
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:06,373
<i>That's why a bear can rest at ease</i>

630
00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:09,413
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

631
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:10,530
Yeah!

632
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:13,925
<i>I'll live here in the jungle</i>
<i>all my life</i>

633
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:17,087
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.

634
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,728
Where we goin', Baloo?

635
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:23,932
Well, it's...

636
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,165
Well, it's sorta new and...

637
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:29,088
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

638
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:35,051
Mowgli... look, buddy,
there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.

639
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:36,363
Tell me what, Baloo?

640
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:38,605
Oh, gee whiz.

641
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,612
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's...

642
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:47,244
Mowgli...

643
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:49,690
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would ya?

644
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:53,006
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

645
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,492
Mowgli, don't you realise
that you're a human?

646
00:43:57,575 --> 00:44:00,533
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

647
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:03,732
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!

648
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,727
Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.

649
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,090
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.

650
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:11,769
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?

651
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:15,245
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin'
all morning to tell ya,

652
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:18,611
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.

653
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:21,687
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.

654
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:25,211
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...

655
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,571
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!

656
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:30,407
That's goin' too far!

657
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:34,327
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?

658
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,971
Wait a minute! Stop!

659
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,408
Wait!

660
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,854
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!

661
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:45,163
Mowgli!

662
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:47,170
Mowgli!

663
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,048
Mowgli!

664
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:54,405
Mowgli. Mowgli!

665
00:44:55,535 --> 00:44:56,854
Now what's happened?

666
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:59,495
Well, you're not gonna
believe me, Bagheera,

667
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,727
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me!

668
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:05,726
Well, don't just stand there.

669
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:09,091
Let's separate. We've got to find him!

670
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:13,851
Oh, if anything happens to that
little guy, I'll never forgive myself.

671
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:15,334
I gotta find him.

672
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:16,848
Mowgli!

673
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:19,644
Mowgli!

674
00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:07,571
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

675
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:10,010
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

676
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,767
<i>Keep it up, two, three, four</i>

677
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,686
What beastly luck.

678
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:16,850
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.

679
00:46:16,935 --> 00:46:19,574
Company... sound off!

680
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,691
<i>Oh, we march from here to there</i>

681
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:24,289
<i>And it doesn't matter where</i>

682
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,094
<i>You can hear us push</i>
<i>through the deepest bush</i>

683
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:28,927
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

684
00:46:29,015 --> 00:46:31,483
<i>With a military air</i>

685
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:34,169
<i>With a military air</i>

686
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,733
The jungle patrol!

687
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,414
<i>We're a crackerjack brigade</i>

688
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:45,725
<i>On a pachyderm parade</i>

689
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:48,534
<i>But we'd rather stroll</i>
<i>to a water hole</i>

690
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:50,810
<i>Hup, two, three, four</i>

691
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,250
<i>For a furlough in the shade</i>

692
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:55,329
Stop!

693
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,130
Wait a minute. Halt!

694
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:04,250
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.

695
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,530
Well, speak up. Who was it?

696
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,412
Oh, it was me, Colonel.

697
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:12,773
What do you mean, sir, taking over
my command? Highly irregular, you know.

698
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:15,847
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry,
but I need your help.

699
00:47:15,935 --> 00:47:18,051
Oh, absolutely impossible.

700
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,807
We're on a cross-country march.

701
00:47:19,895 --> 00:47:22,170
But it's an emergency, Colonel.

702
00:47:22,255 --> 00:47:25,452
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub? What man cub?

703
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:27,173
How interesting.

704
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:30,292
The one I was taking
to the man-village.

705
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,764
Good. That's where he belongs.

706
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:36,404
Now, sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to get on with the march.

707
00:47:36,495 --> 00:47:39,885
No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.

708
00:47:39,975 --> 00:47:43,524
He is lost. He ran away.

709
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,571
How delightful.

710
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,886
Well, it serves
the young whippersnapper right.

711
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:51,773
But Shere Khan, the tiger,

712
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:54,528
is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.

713
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:58,769
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

714
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:01,574
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.

715
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:08,733
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war
and all that sort of thing, you know.

716
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:11,648
This has gone far enough.

717
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:13,691
Far enough!

718
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:17,404
Now, just a minute,
you pompous old windbag!

719
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:20,567
Winifred! What are you doing
out of ranks?

720
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:22,213
Never mind.

721
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:27,253
How would you like to have our boy
lost and alone in the jungle?

722
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:29,724
Our son... alone?

723
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:33,854
But, Winifred, old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

724
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:36,566
Different, entirely.

725
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:39,772
That little boy is
no different than our own son.

726
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:43,768
Now you help find him
or I'm taking over command.

727
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:46,449
What? A female leading my herd?

728
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:48,332
Utterly preposterous.

729
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:51,373
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.

730
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,969
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.

731
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:56,694
Please, Pop, sir? Please?

732
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:59,494
Now, don't you worry, son.

733
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:04,170
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.

734
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:08,013
Sure you did.

735
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:11,489
Troopers!

736
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,567
Company... left face!

737
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:18,604
Volunteers for a special mission

738
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:20,492
will step one pace forward.

739
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:34,684
That's what I like to see.

740
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:36,572
Devotion to duty.

741
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:41,693
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.

742
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,687
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.

743
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:46,527
Yes. Yes.

744
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:49,812
Bugler, when the man cub is sighted,

745
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:53,126
you will sound your trumpet three times.

746
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:54,330
Yes, sir.

747
00:49:56,975 --> 00:49:58,727
Not now, soldier.

748
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:00,407
Sorry, sir.

749
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:04,889
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be
the element of surprise.

750
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:09,765
You will take one squad
and cover the right flank.

751
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:11,049
Yes, sir.

752
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:15,572
And I shall meet the other squad
on the left flank.

753
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:17,604
Very well.

754
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,367
Company...

755
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,489
...forward... march!

756
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,651
Element of surprise?

757
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:38,044
Oh, I say.

758
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:42,768
And now for my rendezvous

759
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:44,811
with the little lost man cub.

760
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,686
Kaa! It's you!

761
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:13,490
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.

762
00:52:13,575 --> 00:52:16,408
So nice to see you again.

763
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:21,408
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.

764
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:24,809
Let me look at you.

765
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,327
You don't want me to look at you?

766
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:32,170
Then you look at me.

767
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,973
No, sir. I know
what you're trying to do, Kaa.

768
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:37,090
You do?

769
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:40,565
I mean, you don't trust me.

770
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:44,967
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.

771
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:47,091
You want to help me?

772
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:49,643
Certainly.

773
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:51,088
I can see to it...

774
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:54,531
...that you never have
to leave this jungle.

775
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:56,769
How could you do that?

776
00:52:56,855 --> 00:52:58,527
Hmm?

777
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:01,083
Oh, I have my own...

778
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:05,487
...s- s-subtle little ways.

779
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:10,008
But first, you must trust me.

780
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,011
I don't trust anyone anymore.

781
00:53:14,335 --> 00:53:16,291
I don't blame you.

782
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:19,046
I'm not like those so-called

783
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:22,252
fair-weather friends of yours.

784
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:25,407
You can believe in me.

785
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:29,887
<i>Trust in me</i>

786
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:35,044
<i>Just in me</i>

787
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:39,524
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

788
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:43,366
<i>And trust in me</i>

789
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,092
Hold still, please.

790
00:53:46,175 --> 00:53:48,530
<i>You can sleep</i>

791
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:52,724
<i>Safe and sound</i>

792
00:53:54,575 --> 00:53:57,248
<i>Knowing I</i>

793
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,210
<i>Am around</i>

794
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:08,250
<i>Slip into silent slumber</i>

795
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:12,684
<i>Sail on a silver mist</i>

796
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:15,050
<i>Slowly and surely</i>

797
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:20,084
<i>Your senses will cease to resist</i>

798
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,966
You're snoring.

799
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:27,407
Sorry.

800
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:31,567
<i>Trust in me</i>

801
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:35,728
<i>And just in me</i>

802
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:40,247
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

803
00:54:41,335 --> 00:54:44,725
<i>And trust in me</i>

804
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,525
Huh?

805
00:54:51,615 --> 00:54:53,606
Oh, now what?

806
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,093
I'll be right down.

807
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,285
Yes? Yes? Who is it?

808
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,684
It's me, Shere Khan.

809
00:55:03,775 --> 00:55:06,209
I'd like a word with you,
if you don't mind.

810
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:11,164
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.

811
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:15,487
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.

812
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:17,725
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

813
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,726
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.

814
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:23,728
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

815
00:55:23,815 --> 00:55:26,170
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.

816
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:29,884
I was just curling up for my siesta.

817
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:31,772
But you were singing to someone.

818
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:35,643
- Who is it, Kaa?
- Who?

819
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:37,532
Oh, no.

820
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:42,769
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.

821
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:47,804
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.

822
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:51,649
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

823
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:54,886
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.

824
00:55:54,975 --> 00:56:00,129
I can't s-s-sleep,
so I sing myself to sleep.

825
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:03,844
You know, self-hypnosis?

826
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:07,245
Let me show you how it works.

827
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:11,013
<i>Trust in me</i>

828
00:56:13,255 --> 00:56:14,813
I can't be bothered with that.

829
00:56:14,895 --> 00:56:16,886
I have no time
for that sort of nonsense.

830
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:20,888
- Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.

831
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,728
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.

832
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:25,965
"Man cub"? What man cub?

833
00:56:26,055 --> 00:56:28,444
The one who's lost.

834
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:30,685
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

835
00:56:30,775 --> 00:56:32,925
Search me.

836
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,404
That's an excellent idea.

837
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:38,612
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

838
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,255
Certainly not.

839
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,766
Nothing here,

840
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:47,323
and nothing in here.

841
00:56:54,775 --> 00:56:56,606
My sinuses.

842
00:56:58,295 --> 00:56:59,569
Indeed.

843
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:02,963
And now, how about the middle?

844
00:57:03,055 --> 00:57:04,613
The middle?

845
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:07,765
Oh, the middle.

846
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,328
Absolutely nothing in the middle.

847
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:19,448
Really?

848
00:57:20,455 --> 00:57:23,652
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub,

849
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:26,203
you will inform me first.

850
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:31,092
- Understand?
- I get the point.

851
00:57:31,175 --> 00:57:34,485
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.

852
00:57:34,575 --> 00:57:39,205
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

853
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:44,083
Who does he think he's fooling?

854
00:57:44,175 --> 00:57:45,927
"Helpless little lad."

855
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:49,564
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.

856
00:57:51,975 --> 00:57:55,490
Picking on that poor little
helpless boy.

857
00:57:57,535 --> 00:57:59,412
Oh, yes.

858
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:02,532
The poor little helpless boy.

859
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:14,132
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.

860
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:16,775
It's like you said.

861
00:58:16,855 --> 00:58:20,609
You can't trust anyone.

862
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:29,888
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again,

863
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:31,806
it will be too soon.

864
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:38,132
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.

865
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:58,529
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?

866
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,411
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

867
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:05,373
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

868
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:08,527
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene.

869
00:59:08,615 --> 00:59:11,254
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.

870
00:59:11,335 --> 00:59:13,849
You mean you wish they were.

871
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,813
Very funny.

872
00:59:19,775 --> 00:59:22,050
OK, so what we gonna do?

873
00:59:23,735 --> 00:59:25,532
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

874
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:28,448
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

875
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,810
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"

876
00:59:30,895 --> 00:59:32,772
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"

877
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:34,846
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!

878
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:37,403
OK. What do you want to do?

879
00:59:37,495 --> 00:59:39,611
Oh, blimey. There you go again.

880
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:41,413
The same notes again.

881
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:45,249
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.

882
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:48,088
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?

883
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:52,214
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.

884
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:54,490
Hey, what in the world is that?

885
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:58,930
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.

886
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:02,007
Yeah, and they're all
walking about by themselves.

887
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,925
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

888
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:12,085
Hey, now, don't start that again.

889
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,528
Come on, lads. Come on.

890
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:17,051
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this little bloke, eh?

891
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,611
Blimey! He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

892
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,732
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

893
01:00:38,095 --> 01:00:41,974
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

894
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:49,647
What's wrong with him?

895
01:00:49,735 --> 01:00:51,168
I think we overdid it.

896
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:53,894
We were just having
a bit of fun, that's all.

897
01:00:53,975 --> 01:00:57,763
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

898
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:00,925
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

899
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:04,212
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.

900
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:07,964
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!

901
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:09,852
Just leave me alone.

902
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:12,051
Oh, come on. What's wrong?

903
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,013
You look like you haven't got
a friend in the world.

904
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:18,610
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

905
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:20,811
No. Nobody wants me around.

906
01:01:20,895 --> 01:01:23,693
Yeah. We know how you feel.

907
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:25,891
Nobody wants us around either.

908
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:29,729
Oh, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got hearts.

909
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,328
And feelings too.

910
01:01:31,415 --> 01:01:33,326
And just to prove it to you,

911
01:01:33,415 --> 01:01:36,134
we're going to let you
join our little group.

912
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:39,764
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honorary vulture.

913
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:43,291
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.

914
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,808
Oh, now, look, kid.

915
01:01:44,895 --> 01:01:46,931
Everybody's got to have friends.

916
01:01:48,215 --> 01:01:51,655
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?

917
01:01:51,655 --> 01:01:53,725
<i>We're your friends</i>

918
01:01:53,815 --> 01:01:56,568
<i>We're your friends</i>

919
01:01:56,655 --> 01:02:00,011
<i>We're your friends to the bitter end</i>

920
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:04,134
<i>The bitter end</i>

921
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:06,775
<i>When you're alone</i>

922
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:09,210
<i>When you're alone</i>

923
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:11,729
<i>Who comes around</i>

924
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,329
<i>Who comes around</i>

925
01:02:14,415 --> 01:02:16,565
<i>To pluck you up</i>

926
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:18,486
- Give us a smile.
- <i>To pluck you up</i>

927
01:02:18,575 --> 01:02:20,452
<i>When you are down</i>

928
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:24,926
<i>When you are down</i>

929
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:28,724
<i>And when you're outside looking in</i>

930
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:32,603
<i>Who's there to open the door?</i>

931
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:34,890
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- <i>That's</i>

932
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:36,010
<i>What</i>

933
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:41,567
<i>Friends are for</i>

934
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:46,006
<i>Who's always eager to extend</i>

935
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:50,210
<i>A friendly claw</i>

936
01:02:51,655 --> 01:02:55,250
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

937
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:57,451
<i>And when you're lost</i>

938
01:02:58,255 --> 01:02:59,893
<i>In dire need</i>

939
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:01,374
<i>Who's at your side</i>

940
01:03:01,455 --> 01:03:03,810
<i>At lightning speed</i>

941
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:07,490
<i>We're friends with every creature</i>
<i>comin' down the pike</i>

942
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:11,807
<i>In fact, we've never met</i>
<i>an animal we didn't like</i>

943
01:03:11,895 --> 01:03:13,374
You take it, kid.

944
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:17,414
<i>Didn't like</i>

945
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:22,006
- <i>So, you can see we're friends</i>
- <i>Friends in need</i>

946
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:24,211
<i>We're friends in need</i>
<i>and friends indeed</i>

947
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:25,444
<i>Friends indeed</i>

948
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:29,005
<i>Oh, friends indeed</i>

949
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:32,451
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- <i>We'll keep you safe in the jungle</i>

950
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:36,767
<i>Forevermore</i>

951
01:03:38,175 --> 01:03:43,249
<i>That's what friends</i>

952
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:48,693
<i>Are for</i>

953
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,650
Bravo. Bravo.

954
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:55,771
An extraordinary performance.

955
01:03:55,855 --> 01:03:59,131
And thank you
for detaining my victim.

956
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:02,048
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.

957
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:06,407
Boo!

958
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:08,884
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!

959
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:11,735
Run, friend! Run!

960
01:04:11,735 --> 01:04:14,488
"Run"? Why should I run?

961
01:04:14,575 --> 01:04:16,486
Why should you run?

962
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:19,294
Could it be possible
that you don't know who I am?

963
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,843
I know you, all right.

964
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:24,244
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.

965
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:29,011
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

966
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:33,606
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

967
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:37,768
Ah! You have spirit for one so small,

968
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:42,133
and such spirit is deserving
of a sporting chance.

969
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:45,605
Now, I'm going to close
my eyes and count to ten.

970
01:04:45,695 --> 01:04:49,768
It makes the chase
more interesting... for me.

971
01:04:50,535 --> 01:04:51,684
One...

972
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,849
...two, three...

973
01:04:55,575 --> 01:04:57,770
...four...

974
01:04:59,455 --> 01:05:01,127
You're trying my patience.

975
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:03,894
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

976
01:05:07,415 --> 01:05:08,848
Run, Mowgli, run!

977
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,850
Let go, you big oaf!

978
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:14,492
Take it easy. Take it easy.

979
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,645
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!

980
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:19,606
Whoa, slow! Easy, now!

981
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:22,163
Whoa! Easy!

982
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:24,052
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.

983
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:25,773
And he better hang on too.

984
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:32,126
Take that, you big bully.

985
01:05:33,135 --> 01:05:36,366
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!

986
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,527
Baloo! Help me!

987
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:55,125
Somebody do something with that kid!

988
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:57,012
Come on, lads!

989
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:04,894
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.

990
01:06:04,975 --> 01:06:08,445
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.

991
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:16,653
I'll kill you for this.

992
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:20,970
Let go! Baloo needs help!

993
01:06:25,455 --> 01:06:28,253
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.

994
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:30,610
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

995
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:38,327
Charge!

996
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:42,408
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!

997
01:06:42,495 --> 01:06:45,009
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!

998
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,645
Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!

999
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:51,566
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!

1000
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:53,850
Look behind you, chum.

1001
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:13,608
Well, that's the last of him.

1002
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,849
Old Stripes took off
like a flaming comet, he did.

1003
01:07:17,935 --> 01:07:20,529
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

1004
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,008
Hold it, fellas.

1005
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:26,246
Now is not the time for it. Look.

1006
01:07:32,575 --> 01:07:33,894
Baloo?

1007
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:43,324
Baloo, get up.

1008
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:46,012
Oh, please, get up.

1009
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:59,733
Mowgli, try to understand.

1010
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,809
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

1011
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:06,092
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

1012
01:08:06,175 --> 01:08:08,564
You... You don't mean...

1013
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:12,248
Oh, no. Baloo.

1014
01:08:17,735 --> 01:08:21,410
Now, now. I know how you feel.

1015
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:25,651
But you must remember, Mowgli,

1016
01:08:26,615 --> 01:08:29,288
"Greater love hath no one

1017
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:33,004
than he who lays down his life
for his friend."

1018
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:35,768
When great deeds

1019
01:08:35,855 --> 01:08:37,607
are remembered in this jungle,

1020
01:08:38,175 --> 01:08:41,690
one name will stand above all others:

1021
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:46,334
Our friend, Baloo the bear.

1022
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:49,487
He's crackin' me up.

1023
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:52,851
The memory of Baloo's
sacrifice and bravery

1024
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:57,008
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

1025
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:58,972
Beautiful.

1026
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:02,968
This spot where Baloo fell
will always be

1027
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,047
a hallowed place in the jungle,

1028
01:09:06,135 --> 01:09:10,526
for there lies one of nature's
noblest creatures.

1029
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:16,248
I wish my mother
could have heard this.

1030
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:18,644
It's best we leave now.

1031
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,685
Come along, Man Cub.

1032
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:24,812
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!

1033
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,693
There's more. Lots more!

1034
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:30,528
Why, you big fraud!

1035
01:09:30,615 --> 01:09:32,526
You four-flusher!

1036
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:34,765
I'm fed up!

1037
01:09:34,855 --> 01:09:38,325
Baloo, you're all right!

1038
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:41,293
Who, me? Sure I am.

1039
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,684
Never felt... better.

1040
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:52,126
- You sure had us worried.
- I was just takin' five.

1041
01:09:52,215 --> 01:09:54,968
You know, playin' it cool.

1042
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:58,525
- But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.

1043
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:02,130
It's going to be a bit dull
without the little bloke, isn't it?

1044
01:10:02,215 --> 01:10:04,729
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

1045
01:10:04,815 --> 01:10:08,046
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!

1046
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,883
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.

1047
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,250
You should have seen
how I made a sucker

1048
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,895
out of Old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

1049
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:19,125
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"

1050
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,854
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.

1051
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:25,291
- You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:29,493
Nothing or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

1053
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:33,933
<i>My own home</i>

1054
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:38,014
<i>My own home</i>

1055
01:10:38,095 --> 01:10:41,485
<i>My own home</i>

1056
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:44,806
<i>My own home</i>

1057
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,684
Look! What's that?

1058
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:52,768
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.

1059
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,163
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.

1060
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,691
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

1061
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:04,573
So you've seen one. So let's go.

1062
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,931
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.

1063
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:11,007
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.

1064
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:12,767
Let him have a better look.

1065
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:24,330
<i>Father's hunting in the forest</i>

1066
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,725
<i>Mother's cooking in the home</i>

1067
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:31,569
<i>I must go to fetch the water</i>

1068
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,772
<i>Till the day that I am grown</i>

1069
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:38,964
<i>Till I'm grown</i>

1070
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:42,491
<i>Till I'm grown</i>

1071
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:46,409
<i>I must go to fetch the water</i>

1072
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:50,807
<i>Till the day that I am grown</i>

1073
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:11,533
<i>Then I will have a handsome husband</i>

1074
01:12:11,615 --> 01:12:14,527
<i>And a daughter of my own</i>

1075
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:18,449
<i>And I'll send her to fetch the water</i>

1076
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:22,687
<i>I'll be cooking in the home</i>

1077
01:12:29,175 --> 01:12:33,373
<i>Then I'll send her to fetch the water</i>

1078
01:12:33,455 --> 01:12:36,572
<i>I'll be cooking in my home</i>

1079
01:12:43,335 --> 01:12:46,884
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.

1080
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:24,048
Mowgli, come back. Come back.

1081
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:26,410
Go on. Go on.

1082
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:52,208
He's hooked.

1083
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:54,450
It was inevitable, Baloo.

1084
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,491
The boy couldn't help himself.

1085
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:58,486
It was bound to happen.

1086
01:13:58,575 --> 01:14:00,805
Mowgli is where he belongs now.

1087
01:14:02,575 --> 01:14:03,610
Yeah.

1088
01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:06,013
I guess you're right.

1089
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,253
But I still think
he'd have made one swell bear.

1090
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:14,851
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.

1091
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:17,051
Let's get back to where we belong.

1092
01:14:17,135 --> 01:14:19,649
And get with the beat.

1093
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:22,488
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

1094
01:14:22,575 --> 01:14:24,611
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

1095
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:27,767
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

1096
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:31,488
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

1097
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,645
<i>Are Mother Nature's recipes</i>

1098
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,852
<i>That bring the bare necessities of life</i>

1099
01:14:37,305 --> 01:15:37,310
