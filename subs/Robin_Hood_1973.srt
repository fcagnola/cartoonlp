2
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,828
You know, there's
been a heap of legends

3
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,122
and tall tales
about Robin Hood.

4
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:40,707
All different too.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,294
Well, we folks of the animal
kingdom have our own version.

6
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,507
It's the story of what really
happened in Sherwood Forest.

7
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,715
Incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.

8
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,676
That's an early-day folk singer.

9
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,136
And my job is to

10
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,556
tell it like it is.
Or was, or whatever.

11
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,938
Robin Hood and Little John
walking through the forest

12
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,774
Laughing back and forth at
what the other'n has to say

13
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,737
Reminiscing this and that

14
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,530
And having such a good time

15
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,742
Golly, what a day

16
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,955
Never, ever thinking
there was danger in the water

17
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,083
They were drinking
They just guzzled it down

18
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,961
Never dreaming
that a scheming sheriff and his posse

19
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,674
Was a-watching them
and gathering around

20
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,344
Robin Hood and Little John
running through the forest

21
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,556
Jumping fences, dodging trees
and trying to get away

22
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,518
Contemplating nothing
but escaping

23
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,853
And finally making it

24
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:40,147
Golly, what a day

25
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,992
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.

26
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,412
Chances? You must be joking.

27
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,373
That was just a bit of a lark,
Little John.

28
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,252
Yeah? Take a look at your hat.
That's not a candle on a cake.

29
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,923
Hello. This one almost
had my name on it, didn't it?

30
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,883
They're getting better, you know.

31
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,970
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.

32
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:08,224
Yeah. The next time that sheriff'll
probably have a rope around our necks.

33
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,769
Pretty hard to laugh
hanging there, Rob.

34
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,980
The sheriff and his whole posse

35
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,898
couldn't lift you
off the ground.

36
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,401
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.

37
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,902
That's the only hat I've got.

38
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,571
Come along.
You worry too much, old boy.

39
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,574
You know something, Robin?
I was just wondering.

40
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,994
Are we good guys or bad guys?

41
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,495
You know. I mean,

42
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,914
our robbing the rich
to feed the poor.

43
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,666
"Rob"?

44
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,293
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.

45
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:40,131
We just sort of borrow a bit
from those who can afford it.

46
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,759
Borrow? Boy, are we in debt.

47
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,521
That sounds like another
collection day for the poor.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,772
Hey, Johnny boy?

49
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,943
Yeah. Sweet charity.

50
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,898
Taxes! Taxes!

51
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,151
Beautiful, lovely taxes!

52
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,697
Sire, you have an absolute skill

53
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,533
for encouraging contributions
from the poor.

54
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,078
To coin a phrase,
my dear counselor,

55
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,498
rob the poor to feed the rich.

56
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,249
Am I right?

57
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,337
Tell me, what is
the next stop, Sir Hiss?

58
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,297
Let me see. I...

59
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,051
Yes. The next stop
is Nottingham, sire.

60
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,054
The richest plum of them all.

61
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,224
Nottingham.

62
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,938
A perfect fit, sire. Most becoming.

63
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,358
You look regal, dignified,
sincere, masterful,

64
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,651
noble...

65
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,237
Don't... Don't overdo it, Hiss.

66
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,866
There. That, I believe, does it.

67
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,121
This crown gives me
a feeling of power!

68
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,539
Power!

69
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,126
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.

70
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,877
Power.

71
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,340
And how well King Richard's
crown sits on your noble brow.

72
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,633
Doesn't it?

73
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,094
King Richard?

74
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,306
Look, I've told you never
to mention my brother's name!

75
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,934
A mere slip of
the forked tongue, Your Majesty.

76
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,230
We're in this plot together,
if you don't mind my saying so.

77
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,817
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotized him and...

78
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,613
I know. And sent him off
on that crazy crusade.

79
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,202
Much to the sorrow
of the Queen Mother.

80
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,788
Yes! Mother.

81
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,710
Mother always did
like Richard best.

82
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,923
Your Highness,
please don't do that.

83
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,426
If you don't mind
my saying so, you see,

84
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,595
you have a very loud thumb.

85
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,434
Hypnotism could rid you
of your psychosis

86
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,855
so easily.

87
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,901
No! None of that! None of that.

88
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,777
Well, I was only trying to help.

89
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,322
I wonder.

90
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,740
Silly serpent.

91
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,367
- "Silly serpent"?
- Now look here.

92
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,788
One more hiss out of you, Hiss,

93
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,167
and you are walking
to Nottingham.

94
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,462
Snakes don't walk. They slither.

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,965
So there.

96
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,874
Now what about that for luck?

97
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,336
It's only a circus.
A peanut operation.

98
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,589
"Peanuts"? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.

99
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,509
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?

100
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,928
Wait a minute. There's a law
against robbing royalty.

101
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,222
- I'll catch you later.
- What?

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,183
And miss this chance
to perform before royalty?

103
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,520
Here we go again.

104
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,527
Fortune tellers!

105
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,488
Fortunes forecast! Lucky charms!

106
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,950
Get the dope
with your horoscope.

107
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,245
Fortune tellers! How droll.
Stop the coach.

108
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,039
Sire, sire, they may be bandits.

109
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,750
Poppycock. Female bandits?

110
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,253
What next? Rubbish.

111
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,673
My dear ladies,

112
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,468
you have my permission
to kiss the royal hands.

113
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,762
Whichever you like, first.

114
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,517
How gracious!

115
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,812
- And generous.
- Sire! Sire!

116
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,939
- Did you see what they...
- Stop!

117
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,274
Stop hissing in my ear.

118
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,410
Hiss! You've hissed your last...

119
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,370
Hiss.

120
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,586
Suspicious snake.

121
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,006
Masterfully done, Your Excellency.

122
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,926
Now close your eyes and concentrate.

123
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,181
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.

124
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:29,355
From the mists of time,
come forth, spirits.

125
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,444
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.

126
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,113
We're waiting.

127
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,618
Look, sire. Look!

128
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,621
Incredible.

129
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
Floating spirits.

130
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,420
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.

131
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,631
How dare you strike the royal hand.

132
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,426
You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.

133
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,726
A face appears.

134
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,356
A crown is on his noble brow.

135
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,110
A crown! How exciting!

136
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,737
His face is handsome,

137
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,783
regal, majestic,

138
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,496
loveable, a cuddly face.

139
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,291
Handsome, regal, majestic.

140
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,335
Loveable. Yes, yes.

141
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:38,090
Cuddly. That's me to a T.

142
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,009
It really is. Yes.

143
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,637
- I...
- Now what?

144
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,849
I...

145
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,769
I see your illustrious name.

146
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,397
I know my name! Get on with it!

147
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,816
Your name will go down,

148
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,778
down, down, in history, of course.

149
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,573
Yes! I knew it! I knew it!

150
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,200
Do you hear that, Hiss? You can't...

151
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,369
He's in the basket.

152
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,872
Don't forget it.

153
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,334
What have we here?

154
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,046
Solid-gold hubcaps.

155
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,310
The jackpot.

156
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,017
Robbed! I've been robbed!

157
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,354
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

158
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,275
- I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!

159
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,072
Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms.

160
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
After them, you fools!

161
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,883
No, no, no, no!

162
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,554
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.

163
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,888
I tried to warn you, but no,

164
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,766
you wouldn't listen.
You just had to...

165
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,309
Seven years' bad

166
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,771
luck. That's what it is.

167
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,400
Besides, you broke
your mother's mirror.

168
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,570
Mommy!

169
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,864
I've got a dirty thumb.

170
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,123
Well, even though Prince John

171
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,543
offered a huge reward
for the capture of Robin Hood,

172
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,713
that elusive rogue kept
right on robbing the rich

173
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,880
to feed the poor.

174
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,466
And believe me,
it's a good thing he did

175
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,302
'cause what with taxes and all,

176
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,222
the poor folks of Nottingham
were starving to death.

177
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,726
Here comes
old Bad News himself,

178
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,021
the honorable
sheriff of Nottingham.

179
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,607
Every town

180
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,359
Has its taxes too

181
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,029
And the taxes is due

182
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,366
Well, lookie there.

183
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,953
Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.

184
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,830
He's out doing good again.

185
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,546
- Well, good morning, Friar Tuck.
- Otto.

186
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,008
For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.

187
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,011
God bless Robin Hood.

188
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,438
It's the sheriff! Hurry, hide it! Quick!

189
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,232
Here I come. Ready or not.

190
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,985
Well, greetings

191
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,614
from your friendly
neighborhood tax collector.

192
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,283
Take it easy on me, sheriff.

193
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,827
What, with this
busted leg and all, you know,

194
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,413
I'm way behind
in me work, sheriff.

195
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,210
I know, Otto, but you're
way behind with your taxes too.

196
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,879
Have a heart, sheriff.

197
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,716
Can't you see he's laid up?
Come on, Otto.

198
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,760
You'd better sit down and rest.

199
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,012
Thank you. Yes.

200
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,061
Let me give you a hand
with that leg.

201
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,896
Upsadaisy.

202
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,399
Bingo!

203
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,069
What they won't think of next.

204
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,157
It smarts, don't it, Otto?

205
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,661
But Prince John says
that taxes should hurt.

206
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,707
Now see here, you...
You evil, flint-hearted leech!

207
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,502
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.

208
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,921
It ain't Sunday, you know.

209
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,302
They call me a slob
but I do my job

210
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:44,055
Happy birthday to you

211
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,817
Happy birthday, dear Skippy

212
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,194
Happy birthday

213
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,782
To you

214
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,828
Well, now, sonny, that box is
done up right pretty, ain't it?

215
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,875
Well, Mr. Sheriff, sir,
it's my birthday present, sir.

216
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,836
It sure is. Why don't you open it?

217
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,883
Oh, boy! One whole farthing!

218
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,011
Have you no heart?

219
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,098
We all scrimped and saved
to give it to him.

220
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:24,186
Now that's mighty thoughty
of you, widow woman.

221
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,024
The family that saves
together pays together.

222
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,902
Now, don't take it so hard, sonny.

223
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,030
Prince John wishes you
a happy birthday too.

224
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:40,035
Alms, alms, alms for the poor.

225
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,913
Well.

226
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,004
Well, so far it's been
a cheerful morning.

227
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,589
Keep saving!

228
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,549
What a dirty trick.

229
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,969
You poor old man.

230
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,723
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.

231
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,851
Thank you kindly, Mother.
Thank you.

232
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:09,731
Tell me now. Did me old ears
hear someone singing a birthday ditty?

233
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,359
Yes, sir.

234
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:17,072
And that mean old sheriff
took my birthday present.

235
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,324
Did he now?

236
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,411
But be a stouthearted little lad
and don't let it get you down.

237
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,581
Gee whiz! It's Robin Hood!

238
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,959
Happy birthday, son!

239
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,172
He's so handsome,
just like his reward posters.

240
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,801
Tell me, young man,
how old are you today?

241
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,470
Gosh, I'm seven years old,
going on eight.

242
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,180
Seven?

243
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,850
Well, that does make you
the man of the house,

244
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,435
and I've got just the right
present for you.

245
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,855
For me?

246
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,984
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir.

247
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, how do I look?

248
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,864
Not much like Mr. Robin Hood.

249
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,283
She's right.
There is something missing.

250
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,662
Of course! There you go.

251
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,874
Boy, oh, boy.
Now, how do I look?

252
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,210
The hat's too big.

253
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,671
Mind your manners.

254
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,882
Yes, mind your matters.

255
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,219
Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.

256
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,805
I'm gonna try it out.

257
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,558
Goodbye, Mr. Robin Hood!

258
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,560
Come again on my birthday!

259
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,149
You have made his birthday
a wonderful one.

260
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,359
How can I ever thank you?

261
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,486
I only wish I could do more.

262
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:42,073
Here. And keep your chin up.

263
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:46,077
Someday there'll be happiness
again in Nottingham. You'll see.

264
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:51,458
Robin Hood. You've risked
so much to keep our hopes alive.

265
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,586
Bless you. Bless you.

266
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,935
Gee, did Robin Hood
really give it to you?

267
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,354
Yeah, and this is his own hat too.

268
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,856
Gee, I'd sure like to
shoot your bow and arrow.

269
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,358
Let me try it, Skippy.

270
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,152
No, you don't.
I'm gonna shoot it first.

271
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:23,031
- You're pointing it too high.
- I'm not either. Watch this.

272
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,123
Now you've done it.

273
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,210
Right in Prince John's backyard.

274
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,261
Skippy, you can't go in there.

275
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,515
Yeah. Prince John
will chop off your head.

276
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,726
Like this.

277
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,104
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.

278
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,439
Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.

279
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,484
Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.

280
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,694
An oath?

281
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,780
Put your hand on your heart
and cross your eyes.

282
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,993
Spiders, snakes and a lizard head.

283
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,037
Spiders, snakes and a lizard's head.

284
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:18,753
If I tattletale, I'll die till I'm dead.

285
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,434
It's your turn to serve, Marian, dear.

286
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,852
Are you ready, Lady Kluck?

287
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,688
As your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.

288
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm getting too old for this.

289
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,703
That was a good shot.

290
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,165
You're not bad yourself, dear.
My girdle's killing me.

291
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,591
Where is it? Did you lose it?

292
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,886
- It must be in there someplace.
- Klucky, you look so silly.

293
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,890
Look. There it is, behind you.

294
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,894
Well, hello.

295
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,771
Where did you come from?

296
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,690
Please don't tell Prince John.

297
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,234
Mama said
he'll chop off my head.

298
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,904
Don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.

299
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,948
Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.

300
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,659
Who does this young archer
remind you of?

301
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,749
Well, upon my word,
the notorious Robin Hood.

302
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,503
That's right. Only Robin Hood
wears a hat like that.

303
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,631
Yeah, and look at this
keen Robin Hood bow.

304
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,430
Marian, don't look around,

305
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,516
but I do believe
we're surrounded.

306
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,770
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.

307
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,355
It's all right, children.

308
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,108
Don't be afraid.
Please come here.

309
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,820
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.

310
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,948
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!

311
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,829
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.

312
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,790
I told Skippy
he was shooting too high.

313
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,586
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.

314
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,464
Gee, you're very beautiful.

315
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,299
Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?

316
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,637
Mama said you and Robin Hood
are sweethearts.

317
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,057
Well...

318
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,102
You see, that was several years
ago before I left for London.

319
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:44,232
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, no.

320
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,569
But he carved our initials
on this tree.

321
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,949
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?

322
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,660
My mom gots a lot of kids.

323
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,079
He's probably
forgotten all about me.

324
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,665
Not Robin Hood.

325
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,085
I bet he'll storm the castle gates,
fight the guards,

326
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,921
rescue you and drag you
off to Sherwood Forest.

327
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,467
Now just a moment there,
young man.

328
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,053
You've forgotten Prince John.

329
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,598
That old Prince John
don't scare me none.

330
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,809
I'm scared of Prince John.

331
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:20,977
He's cranky.

332
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:27,192
I, Prince John,
challenge you to a duel.

333
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,318
Hey, hey!

334
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,279
Take that! And that! And this!

335
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,617
Death to tyrants!

336
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,205
Slice him to pieces!

337
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:44,500
Save me, my hero. Save me.

338
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,087
That's not fair.

339
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,466
Mommy!

340
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,802
That's Prince John, all right.

341
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,306
Now I've got you!

342
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,059
Mercy! Mercy!

343
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,731
He got me. I'm dying.

344
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,692
Did I hurt you?

345
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:14,614
No. This is the part where you drag
your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.

346
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,660
Come on, lady fair! Let's go!

347
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,998
Robin, you're so brave and impetuous.

348
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,753
So this is Sherwood Forest.

349
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,923
Yeah, I guess so.

350
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,008
Well, now what are we gonna do?

351
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,179
Well, usually the hero
gives his fair lady a kiss.

352
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,683
A kiss? That's sissy stuff.

353
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,520
Well, if you won't, then I will.

354
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,816
They're kissing!

355
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,183
Me. Young love.

356
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,561
It's a grand thing.

357
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,858
Klucky, surely he must know
how much I still love him.

358
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,569
But, of course, my dear.

359
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:39,741
Believe me, someday soon,
your uncle, King Richard,

360
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,910
will have an outlaw
for an in-law.

361
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:48,458
Oh, Klucky. But when? When?

362
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,960
Patience, my dear. Patience.

363
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,297
Remember, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

364
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,883
Or forgetful.

365
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,470
I've been away so long.

366
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,598
What if he's forgotten
all about me?

367
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,196
Hey, lover boy.

368
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,573
How's that grub coming?
Man, I'm starved.

369
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,746
Rob? Robin?

370
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,957
Robert?

371
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,753
- Hey!
- What? What do you say?

372
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,589
Forget it.
Your mind's not on food.

373
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,343
You're thinking about somebody
with long eyelashes,

374
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,137
and you're smelling
that sweet perfume.

375
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,311
- Hey, It's boiling over!
- You're burning the chow!

376
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,481
Sorry, Johnny.

377
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,317
Guess I was thinking
about Maid Marian again.

378
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,319
I can't help it.

379
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,239
I love her, Johnny.

380
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,534
Look, why don't you stop
mooning and moping around?

381
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,329
- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?

382
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,707
You don't just walk up to a girl,
hand her a bouquet and say,

383
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,627
"Hey, remember me? We were kids
together. Will you marry me?"

384
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,630
No. It just isn't done that way.

385
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,801
Come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.

386
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:26,472
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.

387
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,851
It's no use, Johnny.
I've thought it all out

388
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,894
and it just wouldn't work.

389
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,105
Besides, what have
I got to offer her?

390
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,357
Well, for one thing,
you can't cook.

391
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,069
I'm serious, Johnny.
She's a highborn lady of quality.

392
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,905
So she's got class? So what?

393
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,782
I'm an outlaw, that's what.

394
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,786
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.

395
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,583
- What kind of a future is that?
- For heaven's sake, son.

396
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,127
You're no outlaw.

397
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,464
Why, someday you'll be called
a great hero.

398
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,340
A hero?

399
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,759
Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.

400
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,805
That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.

401
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,141
All right. Laugh, you two rogues.

402
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,812
But there's gonna be
a big to-do in Nottingham.

403
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,733
Well-done, ain't it?

404
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,152
Old Prince John's having

405
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,946
a championship
archery tournament tomorrow.

406
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,324
Archery tournament?

407
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,160
Old Rob could win that
standing on his head, Rob?

408
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:34,081
Thank you, Little John,
but I'm sure we're not invited.

409
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,001
No, but there's somebody

410
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,129
who'll be very disappointed
if you don't come.

411
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,090
Yeah, old bushel britches,

412
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,426
the honorable sheriff
of Nottingham.

413
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,596
No, Maid Marian.

414
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,432
- Maid Marian?
- Yeah.

415
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,185
She's gonna give
a kiss to the winner.

416
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,438
A kiss to the winner!

417
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,442
Come on, Johnny!
What are we waiting for?

418
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,194
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it.

419
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,405
That place will be
crawling with soldiers.

420
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,076
But, remember.

421
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,371
Faint hearts never
won fair lady.

422
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,706
Fear not, my friends.

423
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,461
This will be
my greatest performance.

424
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,121
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.

425
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:59,292
A coup d'état,
to coin a Norman phrase.

426
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,086
Yes, indeed, sire.

427
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,382
Your plan to capture Robin Hood
in public is sheer genius.

428
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:11,178
Hiss, no one sits
higher than the king.

429
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,348
Must I remind you, Hiss?

430
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,978
Forgive me, sire. I didn't mean to...

431
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,856
My trap is baited and set,

432
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,774
and then revenge!

433
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,861
Revenge!

434
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,655
Not so loud, sire.

435
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,368
Remember, only you and I know,
and your secret is my secret.

436
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,787
Stop! Stop hissing in my ear.

437
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,665
Secret? What secret?

438
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,877
Why, the capture
of Robin Hood, sire.

439
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,713
That insolent blackguard.

440
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,842
I'll show him
who wears the crown!

441
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,345
I share your loathing, sire.

442
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,098
That scurrilous scoundrel
who fooled you with that silly disguise,

443
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,352
who dared to rob you and made you
look so utterly ridiculous...

444
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,895
Enough!

445
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,274
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.

446
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,903
But... But... Sire, please.

447
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,406
Stop sniveling and hold still.

448
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,037
Thank you, sire.

449
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,748
Klucky, I'm so excited.

450
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,958
But how will I recognize him?

451
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,711
He'll let you know somehow.

452
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,174
That young rogue of yours
is full of surprises, my dear.

453
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,345
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?

454
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,431
Cool it, lover boy.

455
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,517
Your heart's running away
with your head.

456
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,060
Stop worrying.

457
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,270
This disguise would
fool my own mother.

458
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,898
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.

459
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,818
You gotta fool
old bushel britches.

460
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,533
- Sheriff, Your Honor?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,203
Meeting you face-to-face
is a real treat.

462
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,746
A real treat.

463
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,290
Well, now, thank you.

464
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,168
Excuse me.
I gotta go win this tournament.

465
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,714
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.

466
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,676
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.

467
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,640
My lord.

468
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:23,519
My esteemed royal sovereign
of the realm.

469
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,272
The head man himself.

470
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,150
You're beautiful.

471
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,903
He has style, hey, Hiss?

472
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,703
You took the words
right out of my mouth, PJ.

473
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,206
"PJ"! I like that.
Do you know I do?

474
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,542
Hiss, put it on my luggage.

475
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,918
PJ.

476
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,881
PJ. Yes.

477
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,550
And you?

478
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,511
Who might you be, sir?

479
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,348
I am Sir Reginald,
Duke of Chutney.

480
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,393
And don't stick your tongue
out at me, kid.

481
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,815
And now, Your Mightiness,
allow me to lay some protocol on you.

482
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,195
Oh, no. Forgive me,
but I lose more jewels that way than...

483
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,572
Please sit down.

484
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,075
Thanks, PJ. Couldn't get
a better seat than this, could you?

485
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,787
The royal box. Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

486
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,749
What's... Excuse me, buster.

487
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:31,086
"Buster"? You, sir, have taken my seat.

488
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,384
Hiss, with you around,
who needs a court jester?

489
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:48,145
Now get out there and keep your
snake eyes open for you-know-who.

490
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,940
You... You mean, I...

491
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,775
I'm being dismissed?

492
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,529
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy. Get lost.

493
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,406
Begone, long one.

494
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,827
What cheek! "Creepy"?

495
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,038
"Buster"? "Long one"?

496
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,415
Who does that dopey duke
think he is?

497
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:13,087
- Now, he's up to something, Friar.
- Yeah. Come on!

498
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,897
Your Ladyship.

499
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,232
Begging your pardon,
but it's a great honor

500
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:19,153
to be shooting for the favor
of a lovely lady like yourself.

501
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,155
I hopes I win the kiss.

502
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,706
Well, thank you,
my thin-legged archer.

503
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:35,127
I wish you luck,
with all my heart.

504
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,839
I wonder.

505
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,304
Your Highness,
with your royal permission,

506
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,892
- we are ready to begin.
- Proceed, captain!

507
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:54,480
The tournament of the golden
arrow will now begin.

508
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,219
Yay, Dad!

509
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,735
A perfect bull's-eye.

510
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,988
Well, well.

511
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,117
That's what you call pulling it
back and letting it go, PJ.

512
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,119
I'm gonna win that golden arrow,

513
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,913
and then I'm gonna present
myself to the lovely Maid Marian and...

514
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:57,793
Listen, scissorbill, if you shoot half as
good as you blabbermouth,

515
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,211
you're better than Robin Hood.

516
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,046
Robin Hood, he says!

517
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,926
I'm tiptop, all right,
but I'm not as good as he is.

518
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,438
That kid's got class.
Ain't he, PJ?

519
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,774
Indeed he has, Reggie.

520
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,279
Bravo! Bravo! Yes.

521
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,532
By the way,

522
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,202
I hear you're having a bit of trouble
getting your hands on that Robin Hood.

523
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,831
He's scared of me,
that's what he is.

524
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,875
You notice he didn't
show up here today.

525
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,795
I could spot him
through them phony disguises.

526
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,673
It's him! It's Robin Hood!

527
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,844
I just can't wait
till I tell His Majesty.

528
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,398
Unhand me, you...

529
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,193
Please, please! I don't drink!

530
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,323
Attention, everyone.

531
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,783
The final contestants are

532
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,371
the honorable sheriff
of Nottingham

533
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,005
and the spindle-legged stork
from Devonshire.

534
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,763
My dear, I suspect you favor
the gangly youth.

535
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,975
Why, yes, sire.

536
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,436
Well, at least he amuses me.

537
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,065
Coincidently,
my dear young lady,

538
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,026
he amuses me too.

539
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,197
For the final shootout,

540
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,742
move the target
back three paces.

541
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,994
You heard him, Nutsy! Get going!

542
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,247
Move it, you birdbrain.

543
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,292
And remember what
you're supposed to do.

544
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,795
Yes, sir, sheriff, sir.

545
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,887
Well,

546
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:19,059
that shot wins the golden arrow,
the kiss and the whole caboodle.

547
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,118
Yay! He did it,
he did it, he did it!

548
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:05,814
Archer, I commend you,
and because of your superior skill,

549
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,942
you shall get what
is coming to you.

550
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,780
Our royal congratulations.

551
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,949
Thank you kindly, Your Highness.

552
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,663
Meeting you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.

553
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,750
Release the royal fingers.

554
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,255
And now I name you the winner,

555
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,925
or, more appropriately,

556
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,636
the loser!

557
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,058
Seize him.

558
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,316
I sentence you to sudden,
instant and even

559
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,860
immediate death!

560
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,321
Oh, no!

561
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,616
Please.

562
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,536
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.

563
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,331
Please have mercy.

564
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,417
My dear emotional lady,
why should I?

565
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,920
Because I love him,
Your Highness.

566
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,047
Love him?

567
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,926
And does this prisoner
return your love?

568
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,849
Marian, my darling,
I love you more than life itself.

569
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,395
Young love.

570
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:31,775
Your pleas have not fallen
upon a heart of stone,

571
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,320
but traitors
to the crown must die!

572
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,031
Traitor to the crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.

573
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:42,160
- Long live King Richard!
- Long live King Richard!

574
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,830
Enough! I am king!

575
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,873
King! King!

576
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,543
Off with his head!

577
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,391
Oh, no.

578
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,022
Stop! Executioner, stop!

579
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,898
Hold your ax!

580
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,736
Okay, big shot. Now tell them
to untie my buddy, or I'll...

581
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,114
Sheriff, release my buddy...

582
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,326
I mean, release the prisoner!

583
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,828
Untie the prisoner?

584
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,539
You heard what he said,
bushel britches.

585
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:33,128
Sheriff, I make the rules,
and since I am the head man...

586
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,048
Not so hard, you mean thing.

587
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,260
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!

588
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,139
Love conquers all!

589
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,355
I owe my life to you,
my darling.

590
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,108
I couldn't have lived
without you, Robin.

591
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,819
There's something funny
going on around here.

592
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,989
Now, PJ, tell my pal
to kiss Maid Marian,

593
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,451
- or I've just found a new pincushion.
- Why, you!

594
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,915
Kill him! Don't stand there!
Kill him!

595
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,809
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!

596
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,774
Kill him!

597
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,903
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!

598
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,160
Take that, you scoundrel.

599
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,496
Help! Robin, help!

600
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,877
Marian, my love,
will you marry me?

601
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,713
Darling, I thought you'd never ask me.

602
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,968
But you could've
chosen a more romantic setting.

603
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:07,097
- And for our honeymoon, London!
- Yes!

604
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,559
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?

605
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,148
What a main event this is.

606
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,695
What a beautiful brawl.

607
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,498
Hey! Who's driving
this flying umbrella?

608
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,675
- We'll have six children.
- Six?

609
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,927
A dozen at least.

610
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,057
Take that!

611
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,647
Attention, everyone.

612
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,767
Stop the girl!

613
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,979
Take that, you scurvy knave!

614
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,148
Seize the fat one!

615
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,895
Long live King Richard!

616
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,236
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

617
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,655
Coming. Coming.

618
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,117
For I'm a jolly good fellow

619
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,077
For I'm a jolly good...

620
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,833
There you are, old boy!

621
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:44,087
PJ, you won't believe this,
but the stork is really Robin Hood.

622
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,756
Robin Hood.

623
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,765
Get out of that, if you can.

624
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,903
Love

625
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,991
It seems like only yesterday

626
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:18,246
You were just a child at play

627
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,876
Now you're all grown up

628
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:26,254
Inside of me

629
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:30,508
Oh, how fast those moments flee

630
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:37,349
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

631
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:42,562
Now the days seem to fly

632
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,150
Life is brief

633
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,070
But when it's gone

634
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:54,449
Love goes on and on

635
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,500
Love will live

636
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,048
Love will last

637
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,430
Love goes on

638
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,433
And on and on

639
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:25,605
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

640
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:30,944
Now the days seem to fly

641
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:35,198
Life is brief

642
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,201
But when it's gone

643
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:43,331
Love goes on and on

644
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,089
Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night.

645
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,925
I wish it would never end.

646
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,552
Surprise!

647
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,179
Long live Robin Hood!

648
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,768
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!

649
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,688
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo!

650
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,815
Hooray!

651
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,736
And down with that
scurvy Prince John!

652
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,362
Yeah.

653
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,241
Oh, the world will sing
of an English king

654
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,160
A thousand years from now

655
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,620
And not because
he passed some laws

656
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,581
Or had that lofty brow

657
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,416
While bonny good King Richard

658
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,918
Leads the great crusade he's on

659
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,087
We'll all have to slave away

660
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,381
For that good-for-nothing John

661
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,717
Incredible as he is inept

662
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,761
Whenever the history
books are kept

663
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,681
They'll call him
the phony king of England

664
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,436
A pox on the phony
king of England

665
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,785
He sits alone on a giant throne

666
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,870
Pretending he's the king

667
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,830
A little tyke who's rather like

668
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:07,957
A puppet on a string

669
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,168
And he throws an angry tantrum

670
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,128
If he cannot have his way

671
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,297
And then he calls for Mom

672
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,549
While he's sucking his thumb

673
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,719
You see he doesn't wanna play

674
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,889
Too late to be known
as John the First

675
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,225
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

676
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,312
A pox on that phony
king of England

677
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,065
Lay that country on me, babe

678
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,821
Come on, Johnny.

679
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,407
Go, laddie, go!

680
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,015
While he taxes us to pieces

681
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,518
And he robs us of our bread

682
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,812
King Richard's crown
keeps slipping down

683
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,313
Around that pointed head

684
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,941
But while there is a merry man

685
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,235
In Robin's wily pack

686
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,404
We'll find a way to make him pay

687
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,072
And steal our money back

688
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,117
A minute before
he knows we're there

689
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,620
Old Rob'll snatch his underwear

690
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,628
The breezy and uneasy
king of England

691
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,547
The sniveling, groveling

692
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,216
Measly, weaselly

693
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,385
Blabbering, jabbering

694
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,554
Jibbering, jabbering

695
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,472
Plundering, plotting

696
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,892
Wheeling, dealing

697
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,729
Prince John
that phony king of England

698
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,647
Yeah

699
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,406
He throws an angry tantrum

700
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,950
If he cannot have his way

701
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,161
He calls for Mom
and sucks his thumb

702
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,163
And doesn't want to play

703
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,832
Too late to be known
as John the First

704
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,461
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

705
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,671
How about that?

706
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,300
That's PJ to a T. Let me try.

707
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,885
Let me try.

708
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,767
Too late to be known
as John the First

709
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,812
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

710
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,775
The fabulous, marvelous,
merciful, chivalrous...

711
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,818
You got it all wrong, Hiss.

712
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,321
The sniveling, groveling
weaselly, measly...

713
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,405
Enough!

714
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,118
But, sire, it's a big hit.

715
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,704
The whole village is singing it.

716
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,832
They are, are they?

717
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,962
Well, they'll be
singing a different tune.

718
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,966
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!

719
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,718
Squeeze every last drop

720
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:09,597
out of those insolent,
musical peasants.

721
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,063
Man, oh, man.

722
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:21,401
That Prince John sure
made good his threat.

723
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,570
And his helpless subjects
paid dearly

724
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,281
for his humiliation, believe me.

725
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,328
Taxes, taxes, taxes.

726
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:36,791
Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of
the poor people of Nottingham.

727
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:41,879
And if you couldn't pay your taxes,
you went to jail.

728
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,467
Yep, I'm in here too.

729
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,511
Nottingham was in deep trouble.

730
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,976
Every town

731
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,981
Has its ups and downs

732
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,403
Sometimes ups

733
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,366
Outnumber the downs

734
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,455
But not in Nottingham

735
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,460
I'm inclined to believe

736
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,965
If we weren't so down

737
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,803
We'd up and leave

738
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,808
We'd up and fly

739
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,770
If we had wings for flying

740
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:45,485
Can't you see
the tears we're crying

741
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,405
Can't there be some happiness

742
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,657
For me

743
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,161
Not in Nottingham

744
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:49,882
Friar Tuck,
I don't think anyone is coming.

745
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,886
You're right, Sexton, but maybe
the sound of this church bell

746
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,931
will bring those poor
people some comfort.

747
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:03,354
We must do what we can
to keep their hopes alive.

748
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,779
How can there be any hope
with that tyrant Prince John

749
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:15,032
taxing the heart and soul
out of the poor people?

750
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,994
Yes, those poor people.

751
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:21,831
Look, our poor box is like our church,

752
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,125
empty.

753
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,678
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.

754
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:39,348
It's not much,
but please take it for the poor.

755
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,059
Your last farthing?

756
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:47,356
Little sister,
no one can give more than that.

757
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,151
Bless you both.

758
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,863
We were just saving it
for a rainy day.

759
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,741
Well, it's raining now.

760
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,744
Things can't get worse.

761
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,162
Howdy, Friar.

762
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,957
Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.

763
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,044
What does that big-bellied bully
want here?

764
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,295
Father!

765
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,925
Well, what have we got here?

766
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,719
Now, just a minute, sheriff!

767
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,722
That's the poor box!

768
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:25,436
It sure is, and I'll just
take it for poor Prince John.

769
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,687
Every little bit helps.

770
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,399
You put that back!

771
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,362
And His Majesty also
blesses you, little sister.

772
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,781
You thieving scoundrel!

773
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,368
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doing my duty.

774
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,287
Collecting taxes for that arrogant,

775
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:47,166
greedy, ruthless,
no-good Prince John?

776
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,253
Listen, Friar,
you're mighty preachy,

777
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:54,423
and you're gonna preach
your neck right into a hangman's noose.

778
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,425
Get out of my church!

779
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:00,846
Out! Out! Out! Out!

780
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,932
Dear me.

781
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,059
You want taxes?

782
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:10,106
I'll give you taxes!

783
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,025
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!

784
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:23,911
You're under arrest
for high treason to the crown.

785
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,206
Oh, no!

786
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,042
There, there, Mother.

787
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,091
Every town

788
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,345
Has its ups and downs

789
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,142
Sometimes ups

790
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,731
Outnumber the downs

791
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,319
But not in Nottingham

792
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,974
Sire, if I may...

793
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,851
May venture an opinion,

794
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,188
you're not your usual
cheerful, genial self today.

795
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,820
I know. I know.

796
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,114
You haven't counted
your money for days.

797
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,077
It always makes you so happy.

798
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:51,624
Sire,

799
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,919
taxes are pouring in,
the jail is full.

800
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,381
And I have good news, sire.

801
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:02,343
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?

802
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:06,138
It's Robin Hood I want,
you idiot!

803
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:11,310
I'd give all my gold if I
could just get my hands on...

804
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,272
Did you say Friar Tuck?

805
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,943
Did I? Yes, I did.

806
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,613
Hiss, I have it!

807
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,993
I'll use that fat friar
as bait to trap Robin Hood.

808
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:29,995
Another trap?

809
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,456
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.

810
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,084
Friar Tuck will be led
to the gallows

811
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,670
in the village square,
don't you see?

812
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:43,008
But, sire, hang Friar Tuck?
A man of the church?

813
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,011
Yes, my reluctant reptile.

814
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,723
And when our elusive hero
tries to rescue

815
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,684
the corpulent cleric,

816
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,856
my men will be ready.

817
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,753
Well, Trigger, everything's
rigged up and all set.

818
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,715
Yep, it's one of the prettiest
scaffolds you ever built, sheriff.

819
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,551
Sheriff, don't you
reckon we ought to give

820
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,511
that there trapdoor a test?

821
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:37,438
Criminently. Now I know why
your mama called you Nutsy.

822
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,774
Alms. Alms for the poor.

823
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:46,405
Do my old ears hear the
melodious voice of the sheriff?

824
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,699
That's right, old man.

825
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,702
What be going on here?

826
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,163
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.

827
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:58,751
No! Hang Friar... Hang Friar Tuck?

828
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,753
You betcha. At dawn.

829
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,298
And maybe it'll even be
a double hanging.

830
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,051
Dummy up, you dummy.

831
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,095
A double hanging?

832
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:14,058
Who'll be the other one
who gets the rope?

833
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,520
Sheriff, he's getting
too all-fired nosy.

834
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,022
I didn't mean nothing.

835
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:25,528
But couldn't there be
trouble if Robin Hood showed up?

836
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:30,324
Well, wouldn't you know,
sheriff, he guessed it.

837
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,743
Nutsy, button your beak.

838
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,662
No need to worry.

839
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:39,250
The sheriff be too crafty,
too clever and too smart

840
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,710
for the likes of him, says I.

841
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,213
You hear that, Nutsy?

842
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:48,217
For being blind, he sure knows
a good man when he sees one,

843
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,219
says I.

844
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:54,932
Sheriff, I still got a feeling that that
snoopy old codger knows too much.

845
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,017
Shut up, Trigger.

846
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,603
He's just a harmless
old blind beggar.

847
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,106
Alms.

848
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,568
Alms for the poor. Alms.

849
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,570
Alms for the poor.

850
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,407
Rob, we can't let them
hang Friar Tuck.

851
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,618
A jailbreak tonight
is the only chance he's got.

852
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,871
A jailbreak? There ain't
no way you can get him.

853
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:21,458
We've got to, Johnny,
or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.

854
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:25,898
One o'clock, and all's well!

855
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:36,283
Nutsy, you'd better set your
brains ahead a couple of hours.

856
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,202
Yes, sir.

857
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,747
Does that there mean
adding or subtracting?

858
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:45,751
- Let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, sheriff, sir.

859
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,796
Nutsy, how can I sleep
with you yelling,

860
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,049
"All's well!" all the time here?

861
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:55,010
Sheriff, everything ain't "all's well."

862
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,347
I got a feeling in my bones
there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute.

863
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:02,267
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.

864
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:06,313
Don't you worry none, sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.

865
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,779
What in tarnation
you trying to do,

866
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,448
- you birdbrain?
- Just doing my duty, sheriff.

867
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,952
You and that itchy
trigger finger of yours.

868
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:30,003
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.

869
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,424
There's something funny
going on around here. Come on.

870
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,884
You cover me.

871
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:44,268
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?

872
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,104
- You bet it is, sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

873
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,856
You go first.

874
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,738
All right, you in there,
come out with your hands up.

875
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,489
Yeah, reach for the sky.

876
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,285
Just you watch this
performance, partner.

877
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,578
Be careful, Rob.

878
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:09,835
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.

879
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,589
Shucks, Trigger, it's only Nutsy.

880
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,842
And criminently,
get back to your patrol.

881
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,887
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-getting! I'm a-getting!

882
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,057
That Trigger.
He's getting everybody edgy.

883
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,602
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar

884
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,522
is gonna dangle from
the gallows come daybreak.

885
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,650
Sheriff,

886
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:38,197
why don't you just sit yourself
down here, kind of cozy-like?

887
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,574
Well, thank you, Nutsy.

888
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,453
Just close your sleepy
little eyeballs.

889
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:47,539
The sandman's a-coming.

890
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:53,295
Why don't you let me loosen that belt?

891
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,423
Rock-a-bye, sheriff

892
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:59,051
Just you relax

893
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,325
Nutsy, that's mighty sweet.

894
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,494
Sing it one more time, would you?

895
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:28,580
Rock-a-bye, sheriff

896
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,582
Just you relax

897
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,264
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!

898
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,767
I heard it! I heard it, sheriff!
The door! The door!

899
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:55,607
Now, for the last time,
no more false alarms.

900
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,194
Now, you release Friar Tuck
and the others,

901
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,280
and I'll drop in
on the royal treasury.

902
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,127
Little John, it can't be!

903
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,046
Quiet. We're busting out of here.

904
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,506
Thank God.

905
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,551
My prayers have been answered.

906
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:45,616
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.

907
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:40,379
Robin Hood!
I'll get even. I'll get...

908
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,748
It's Robin Hood I... I want...

909
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:13,847
Praise the Lord
and pass the tax rebate!

910
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,144
Come on. Follow me.

911
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,165
Now, sheriff...
Now, don't get your dander up,

912
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,210
but I still got a feeling that...

913
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,172
Friar, get going. Hurry.

914
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,239
Guards! Guards! My gold!

915
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,001
No, no, no.

916
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,295
They're getting away
with my gold.

917
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:12,924
Guards! Guards! To the jail!

918
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,969
Rhinos, halt! Stop! Desist!

919
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,727
Everybody, this way!

920
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,140
That's all of them. Get going.

921
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,773
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here.

922
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,320
On to Sherwood Forest!

923
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,322
Stop! My baby!

924
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,950
Mama, Mama, wait for me.

925
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,926
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.

926
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,966
This time, we got him for sure.

927
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,752
Shoot him!

928
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,268
Kill him! Kill him!

929
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:24,616
Come on, Rob. Come on.

930
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:27,285
He's just gotta make it.

931
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,961
No! No. No.

932
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:40,256
Hiss, he's finished! Done for!

933
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:49,307
He's gonna make it,
isn't he, Little John?

934
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,078
Hey, what's that?

935
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,583
Little John, look it! Look it!

936
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,213
Hey, what the...

937
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,051
Man, did you have me worried, Rob.

938
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:29,264
- I thought you were long gone.
- Not Robin Hood.

939
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:35,311
He could've swum twice that far,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir?

940
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:39,816
Look, sire! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.

941
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:43,153
A pox on that
phony King of England!

942
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:49,576
Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.

943
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,286
Well, I tried to tell you,

944
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,455
but, no, no, no,
you wouldn't listen.

945
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,290
Your traps just never work.

946
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:58,209
And now look what you've done
to your mother's castle.

947
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,963
Mommy!

948
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,219
- Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!

949
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,555
Please! Oh, no!

950
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,558
Procrastinating python!

951
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,481
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!

952
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,400
You eel in snake's clothing!

953
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:26,905
Help! He's gone stark raving mad!

954
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,673
You know,
I thought we'd never get rid

955
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,008
of those two rascals,

956
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:50,470
but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned,

957
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:53,598
and, well, he just
straightened everything out.

958
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,696
Say, we'd better get over to the church.

959
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,698
Sounds like somebody's
getting hitched.

960
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,163
Long live Robin Hood!

961
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,672
Long live King Richard!

962
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,008
Friar Tuck,

963
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:33,805
it appears that I now have
an outlaw for an in-law.

964
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,141
Yes, not bad.

965
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:45,233
Gee, Skippy,
how come you're going?

966
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,236
Well, Robin Hood's
gonna have kids,

967
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,989
so somebody's gotta keep
their eye on things.

968
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:01,874
I've never been so happy.

969
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:22,145
Hey, here comes the bride, Trigger.

970
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,481
Present arms!

971
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,284
Well, folks,

972
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,661
that's the way
it really happened.

973
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:44,626
Love goes on and on

973
01:22:45,305 --> 01:23:45,684
