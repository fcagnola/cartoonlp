00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:35,212
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

3
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:37,965
so I choosed another scary one

4
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,178
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

5
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,013
I wasn't scary at all.

6
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,150
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

7
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,235
I don't really care about winning.

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,823
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

9
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:06,866
I've gotten tired of it.

10
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:10,495
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

11
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,039
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

12
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:17,251
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

13
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:20,003
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

14
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:21,463
Not the lazy game.

15
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:31,180
They're here.

16
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,145
Lewis?

17
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:41,398
Lewis?

18
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,992
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

19
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:54,702
They are gonna love this!

20
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,705
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

21
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,956
Lewis!

22
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,208
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

23
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,126
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

24
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,337
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

25
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,631
Smile. Let's fix your...

26
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,675
Mildred.

27
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,135
All right, all right, all right, all right.

28
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,137
Go show them how special you are.

29
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,181
Oh, I hope this is it.

30
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,016
I hope he gets adopted.

31
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,767
You and me both, chief.

32
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:25,230
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

33
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,691
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

34
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:30,359
The possibilities are endless.

35
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,570
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

36
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,531
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

37
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,033
and we can make the world
a better place.

38
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,453
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

39
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,580
So, what's your favourite sport?

40
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:46,207
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

41
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:48,418
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

42
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,962
- What is that?
- First, a question.

43
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:53,381
What's the number one problem
that you face

44
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,216
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

45
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,634
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,678
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

47
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,887
takes forever to chew.

48
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:04,766
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

49
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,519
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

50
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,978
is within mankind's grasp,

51
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:11,397
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

52
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:13,733
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

53
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:14,942
Honey, it's okay.

54
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,902
As you can see, toasting is an option.

55
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:19,196
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

56
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,199
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

57
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,075
It's jammed!

58
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,704
Lewis, please, don't!

59
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:37,796
What's happening?

60
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,757
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

61
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,592
I'm sorry!

62
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,261
Here let me help you get that off!

63
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:46,137
Stand back!

64
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,934
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

65
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

66
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,771
It was really nice to meet you.

67
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,690
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

68
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,984
Hi, folks. Everything all...

69
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,194
What happened?

70
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,779
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

71
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,322
Now, if you'll excuse me.

72
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:10,410
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

73
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:21,753
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

74
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:25,256
Poor Mr Harrington.

75
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:28,927
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

76
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,012
I called. He's perfectly fine.

77
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,473
I was just gonna say that it's...

78
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,267
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

79
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,936
from that wonderful invention of yours.

80
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,146
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

81
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:43,773
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

82
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,817
One hundred twenty-four.

83
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,402
What?

84
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,030
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

85
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:52,240
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

86
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,617
You're exaggerating just to make your

87
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,369
point.

88
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,496
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

89
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:03,125
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

90
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,795
I have no future. No one wants me.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,962
That's not true, Lewis!

92
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,756
My own mother didn't even want me.

93
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,258
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

94
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,759
Then why'd she give me up?

95
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,553
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

96
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:17,179
Did you ever think of that?

97
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:22,100
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

98
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:24,227
I never thought of it that way.

99
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:27,647
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,525
You're right.

101
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,320
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

102
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,197
Wait. I said "maybe."

103
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:39,116
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

104
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,701
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:44,204
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

106
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,705
and we'll be a family again!

107
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

108
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:52,503
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

109
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,382
Wrong. I saw her

110
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:57,591
once.

111
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:01,345
She's in here. I just have to remember.

112
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,433
That's it!

113
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,270
<i>Hello</i>

114
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:14,231
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

115
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:17,818
<i>But it's crazy</i>

116
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:21,405
<i>I got something to show you</i>

117
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,950
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

118
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:29,203
<i>One more glance
And I will make of you</i>

119
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,832
<i>Another believer</i>

120
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:38,045
<i>Guess what?
You got more than you bargained</i>

121
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,214
<i>Ain't it crazy?</i>

122
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,968
<i>You got more than you paid for</i>

123
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:48,388
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

124
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:51,098
<i>One more glance</i>

125
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:56,186
<i>One more hand to hold</i>

126
00:07:56,395 --> 00:08:03,193
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

127
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:06,821
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

128
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:13,494
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

129
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:18,207
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

130
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,709
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

131
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,545
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

132
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,549
<i>What are we gonna do about it?</i>

133
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:34,346
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

134
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,891
<i>One more chance</i>

135
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:43,230
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

136
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,692
<i>One more chance</i>

137
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,987
So tired.

138
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:56,367
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

139
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,785
Bye-bye, now.

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,496
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

141
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,665
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

142
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,834
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

143
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,044
I just hope I can stay awake.

144
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:10,046
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

145
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:13,924
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

146
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,759
but that's what happens

147
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:19,138
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

148
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,437
Ah, that's good joe.

149
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:31,816
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

150
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,944
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

151
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,155
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

152
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,949
Now the neural circuits will connect.

153
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,951
I've cracked the hippocampus!

154
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,953
Really? Okay. What?

155
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,871
Now to test it out.

156
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,709
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

157
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:52,918
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

158
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:54,712
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

159
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,213
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

160
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:58,632
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

161
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,634
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

162
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,636
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

163
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,764
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

164
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:09,684
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

165
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,103
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

166
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:15,940
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

167
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:17,983
I am, and this is it.

168
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:19,318
This is my future.

169
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,903
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,406
Lewis? Honey?

171
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,496
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

172
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:32,705
at Inventco Labs,

173
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,790
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

174
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:36,834
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

175
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,002
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

176
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:41,171
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

177
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,714
Oh, wait! I said that already.

178
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,633
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

179
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,760
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

180
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,845
I haven't slept in eight days!

181
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,681
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

182
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:54,809
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

183
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,561
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

184
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,105
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

185
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:02,315
Sorry. Who's this?

186
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:05,068
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

187
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,820
Oh, so cute!

188
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:09,322
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

189
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,743
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

190
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,412
It's actually a toga, sir.

191
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:19,998
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

192
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,584
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

193
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,712
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

194
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,088
It's my gym.

195
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,674
Stanley. Volcano.

196
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,304
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

197
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,476
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

198
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,686
Dr Krunklehorn?

199
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:44,813
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

200
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,900
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

201
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,735
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

202
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,361
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

203
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:54,196
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

204
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,708
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

205
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,001
That's right.

206
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,585
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

207
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,546
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

208
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:13,923
Only my enemies.

209
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,301
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

210
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:20,178
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

211
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,818
This area's not secure. Get in.

212
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:39,571
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

213
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,907
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

214
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,534
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

215
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,703
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

216
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:48,997
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

217
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,165
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

218
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,416
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

219
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,960
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

220
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,170
No, why?

221
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,672
I could lose my badge for this.

222
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,507
He's a suspect in a robbery.

223
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:01,717
What did he steal?

224
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,135
- A time machine.
- A what?

225
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,388
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

226
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,181
Me? Why me?

227
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:10,266
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

228
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,351
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

229
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,811
I know what HQ means.

230
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,479
Good. You're a smart kid.

231
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,648
That might keep you alive, for now.

232
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,316
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

233
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,568
and leave the "perp" to me.

234
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,446
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

235
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,573
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

236
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,286
Bowler Hat Guy!

237
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,249
My frogs!

238
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:38,625
You're not gonna get away with it,

239
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:42,421
kid with science project.

240
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:45,173
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

241
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,968
My frogs! They're getting away!

242
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,499
Got you! That's the last of them.

243
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:24,960
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

244
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,169
I'm on a very important...

245
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:29,505
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,675
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

247
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,926
Coach...

248
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,177
Next up is Lewis.

249
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,471
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

250
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:39,973
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

251
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:44,686
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

252
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:47,730
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

253
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:51,192
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

254
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,531
Okay, stand back, everybody.

255
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,325
This next project
will knock your socks off.

256
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,161
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

257
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,414
Have you ever forgotten something,

258
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,043
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

259
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:14,088
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

260
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,675
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

261
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,385
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

262
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,430
I call it the Memory Scanner.

263
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,682
It's shiny!

264
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:28,476
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

265
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,979
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

266
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:36,442
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

267
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,027
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

268
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:41,071
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

269
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,783
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

270
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,785
Why that particular day?

271
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,870
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

272
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,665
Well, that was the day...

273
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,794
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

274
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,462
Fair enough. Play ball.

275
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,132
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,317
Lewis, wait!

277
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,121
She's gonna blow!

278
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:38,248
Watch out!

279
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,337
Feel the pain! Love the...

280
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,506
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

281
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,679
Make it stop!

282
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,139
Coach, suck it up, okay?

283
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,684
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

284
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,602
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

285
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,312
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

286
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,065
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

287
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:06,691
Not now.

288
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,862
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

289
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,071
toward the exits.

290
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,118
Wait, Lewis!

291
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:39,596
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

292
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,507
Hey, what are you doing up here?

293
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,231
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

294
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:23,775
You're blowing my cover.

295
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,485
We're the only ones up here.

296
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,570
That's just what they want you to think.

297
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,280
Now, enough moping.

298
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:32,325
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

299
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,326
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

300
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,494
Maybe you've forgotten.

301
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,163
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

302
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,415
That's no badge.

303
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,835
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

304
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,004
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

305
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:48,089
but I really am from the future,

306
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:50,174
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

307
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,509
Here we go again.

308
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:53,552
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

309
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:54,762
and ruined your project.

310
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,181
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

311
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,808
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

312
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,518
and you're not from the future!

313
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:02,686
You're crazy!

314
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,604
I am not crazy.

315
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,065
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

316
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,526
Yeah, that's what I thought.

317
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,487
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

318
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,531
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

319
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:18,992
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

320
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,328
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

321
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:23,371
Hey, let go of me!

322
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:25,540
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

323
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,936
What is this? Where are we going?

324
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,396
To the future!

325
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:13,042
<i>The future has arrived</i>

326
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,795
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

327
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:19,256
<i>The future has arrived</i>

328
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,135
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

329
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,548
Is this proof enough for you?

330
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,258
Is it ever!

331
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,386
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

332
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:12,930
and here it is, right in front of me!

333
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,807
The truth will set you free, brother.

334
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,810
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

335
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,812
This means
I could really change my life.

336
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,314
That's right. You can.

337
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,774
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

338
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:27,652
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

339
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:31,322
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

340
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,157
Why should I fix my dumb invention

341
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:36,702
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

342
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:42,499
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

343
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:45,460
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

344
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:47,921
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

345
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,172
What are you doing?

346
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:50,465
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

347
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,425
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

348
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,343
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

349
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,345
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

350
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,640
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

351
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:01,141
That makes me older.

352
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,350
Well, I was born in the past,

353
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,519
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

354
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:24,537
I am so dead.

355
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,833
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

356
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,334
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

357
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,212
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

358
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:35,005
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

359
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,173
- or something?
- No!

360
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,383
There's only two time machines
in existence,

361
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,302
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

362
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:42,888
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

363
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:46,057
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

364
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:48,601
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

365
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,270
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

366
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,565
All right, under one condition.

367
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,651
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

368
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:00,696
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

369
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:01,905
How can I trust you?

370
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,741
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

371
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,576
How can I trust you?

372
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:08,411
<i>Touché.</i>

373
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,081
So do we have a deal?

374
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:45,236
Good day, madam.

375
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:48,823
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

376
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:52,785
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

377
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,163
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

378
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,956
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

379
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,292
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

380
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,461
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

381
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,464
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

382
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,258
What time is your appointment?

383
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,721
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

384
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,472
You're the 2:00?

385
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,641
Yes. Yes, I am.

386
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,518
You're Mary Johnson?

387
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,978
Yes.

388
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,731
Mary is short for...

389
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,816
Marian?

390
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,819
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

391
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:32,446
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

392
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:33,948
Oh, goody!

393
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:48,670
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

394
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,421
The board is ready to see you now.

395
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,883
Wait. What am I going to say?

396
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,885
I'm never gonna remember that.

397
00:25:57,136 --> 00:26:00,389
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

398
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:02,724
That's true.

399
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:05,518
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

400
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:06,728
as its own.

401
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:12,108
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

402
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:21,867
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

403
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:25,870
Prepare to be amazed!

404
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:31,042
"This is my invention."

405
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:35,212
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

406
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,380
Very well,

407
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:38,715
Miss Johnson?

408
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,759
It's Ms.

409
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:43,470
You have two minutes. Please begin.

410
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,476
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

411
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:55,147
Well, I like to call it my...

412
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,149
To call it my...

413
00:26:57,274 --> 00:27:01,445
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

414
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,363
Well, then let me close the blinds.

415
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:11,078
Now, the name?

416
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:13,164
Well, what...

417
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:14,957
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

418
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:17,835
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

419
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,296
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

420
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:25,300
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

421
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,682
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

422
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,600
Yes, thank you.

423
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:37,353
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

424
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:39,897
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

425
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,648
Oh, nothing of consequence.

426
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:46,528
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

427
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,156
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

428
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,991
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

429
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:54,285
Thirty seconds.

430
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,666
Allow me to show you how it works.

431
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,834
First, we turn it on.

432
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,797
That's not it.

433
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:10,758
Ten seconds.

434
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,861
So where do I sign?

435
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:45,167
Doris, it's all over.

436
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:47,253
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

437
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:51,090
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

438
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,050
You're right.

439
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:56,928
Success is still ours for the taking.

440
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,266
We must find that boy.

441
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:08,772
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

442
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:09,940
What about your parents?

443
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:11,191
Mom never goes in there,

444
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,402
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

445
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:14,569
You've got till then to fix it.

446
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,864
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

447
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,325
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

448
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,288
<i>Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?</i>

449
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:28,457
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

450
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:31,752
<i>None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.</i>

451
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:34,296
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

452
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:37,716
<i>Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.</i>

453
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:39,968
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

454
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:41,427
<i>You...</i>

455
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:44,222
<i>Good point.</i>

456
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,309
Welcome back, little buddy.

457
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:50,978
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

458
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:53,647
Did you find it? Apparently not,

459
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,399
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

460
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:58,068
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

461
00:29:58,193 --> 00:30:00,737
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

462
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:02,905
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

463
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,157
Hi, I'm Lewis.

464
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,664
Well, that was unexpected.

465
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,833
As was that.

466
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,460
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

467
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,671
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

468
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

469
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,176
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

470
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,011
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

471
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,846
That is an excellent question.

472
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:30,431
Wait! Where are you going?

473
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:32,015
Another excellent question.

474
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,477
But I don't just want to sit here.

475
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,020
Stay.

476
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,355
But...

477
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:55,287
Wow!

478
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:02,710
Hey, ring my doorbell.

479
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,212
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

480
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:06,422
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

481
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:10,551
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

482
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,135
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

483
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,387
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

484
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:14,971
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

485
00:31:15,097 --> 00:31:16,139
Evergreen.

486
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:23,646
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

487
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,483
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

488
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:31,278
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

489
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:34,281
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

490
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:36,074
That and someone took my bike.

491
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,910
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

492
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,788
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

493
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,831
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

494
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:45,416
Then he fixes the time machine.

495
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,293
Why is it an acorn?

496
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,128
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

497
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:51,255
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

498
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,965
His confidence in inventing is restored.

499
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,550
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

500
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:57,594
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

501
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,471
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

502
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,431
I just told him that to buy some time.

503
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,892
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

504
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:06,769
Trust me. I got it under control.

505
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,979
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

506
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,983
But on the slight chance that I do...

507
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:16,278
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

508
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:21,282
What is it?

509
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,117
Well, it's not...

510
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:28,330
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

511
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:33,293
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

512
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:36,796
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

513
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,298
I won't exist?

514
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,924
And where does that leave me?

515
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:42,343
Alone, rusting in a corner.

516
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:47,306
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

517
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:54,396
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

518
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,814
and get some quiet time.

519
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:00,360
What's...

520
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,737
Well, hey, there, little fella!

521
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:06,574
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

522
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,242
My head is!

523
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:12,538
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

524
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:15,165
They didn't laugh, either.

525
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,334
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

526
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,502
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

527
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:22,714
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

528
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,465
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

529
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:28,177
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

530
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:30,429
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

531
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:31,638
Wilbur left me down there,

532
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,056
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

533
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:34,224
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

534
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,226
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

535
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:37,894
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

536
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,646
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

537
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:41,230
and lookie there!

538
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:42,398
Hope he ain't got rabies.

539
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,692
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

540
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:48,696
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

541
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,781
Welcome to the garage.

542
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,950
Well, I'm completely lost.

543
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,159
Hiya, Grandpa.

544
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,368
Hey, Aunt Billie.

545
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,037
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

546
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,414
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

547
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,874
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

548
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,878
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

549
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,214
That's a toy train?

550
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:15,303
On your mark, get set, go?

551
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,351
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

552
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,979
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

553
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,398
Lewis?

554
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,526
<i>- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.</i>

555
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,693
<i>Keep those tummies tucked.</i>

556
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,905
This isn't the garage.

557
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,072
I know.

558
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,575
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

559
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,369
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

560
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:44,038
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

561
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:46,082
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

562
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:48,500
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

563
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:52,004
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

564
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:54,798
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

565
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:56,258
Lewis?

566
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:59,385
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

567
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,220
Oh, yeah!

568
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:11,897
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

569
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:14,316
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

570
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:17,777
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

571
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:19,863
What is all the yelling out here?

572
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,155
- He started it!
- She started it!

573
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,615
I don't want to hear any more!

574
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,202
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

575
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:28,621
I'm going for a drive!

576
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,835
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

577
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,753
Lewis!

578
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:39,547
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

579
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,259
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

580
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:44,719
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

581
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:47,930
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

582
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:50,766
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

583
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,311
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

584
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:57,314
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

585
00:35:58,565 --> 00:35:59,899
Nice to meet you.

586
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,318
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

587
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,821
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

588
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,032
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

589
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:09,825
I think you'll like her.

590
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,413
Hey, guys!

591
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:19,959
<i>You ask me over
And over and over</i>

592
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:23,171
<i>Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?</i>

593
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:24,463
Frogs?

594
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:26,090
Taught them everything they know.

595
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:29,176
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

596
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:32,846
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

597
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:37,309
<i>Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that</i>

598
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:39,519
<i>Even though you've him, her, me</i>

599
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:42,230
<i>And an army searching</i>

600
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:47,943
<i>I've got a feeling
You will be reeling</i>

601
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:51,655
<i>When you are bad
And the circus comes to town</i>

602
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,490
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

603
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:55,408
<i>And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician</i>

604
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:56,660
<i>Or something like that</i>

605
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:01,039
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

606
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,582
Ring-a-ding-ding.

607
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:09,588
All right!

608
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:12,841
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

609
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,385
but, wow, look at the time.

610
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,889
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

611
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:22,141
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

612
00:37:23,226 --> 00:37:24,769
You met my family?

613
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:28,772
Pop quiz.

614
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,357
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

615
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,484
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

616
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,986
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

617
00:37:35,112 --> 00:37:36,321
Cranky? Yes.

618
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:37,864
<i>Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.</i>

619
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,949
<i>Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.</i>

620
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,200
<i>Spike and Dimitri are twins,</i>

621
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,119
and I don't know who they're related to.

622
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:44,328
Neither do we. Go on.

623
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,873
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

624
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,501
What does Cornelius look like?

625
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,919
Tom Selleck.

626
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:57,132
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

627
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:58,466
You're forgetting something.

628
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,801
Forgetting? Oh, right.

629
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:02,387
<i>Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.</i>

630
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,138
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

631
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:05,306
Nope.

632
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:06,932
Thank you. Thank you.

633
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:10,477
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

634
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,700
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

635
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:34,249
I've got you now.

636
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,792
Lewis!

637
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:41,506
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

638
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:45,009
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

639
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:48,679
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

640
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,515
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

641
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,559
Nice to see that they're branching out.

642
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:57,228
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

643
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,439
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

644
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:02,525
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

645
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,778
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

646
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:09,198
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

647
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,243
Game didn't go so well, huh?

648
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:17,872
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

649
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:19,791
Then I got beat up.

650
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:24,128
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

651
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,297
I don't know. He's probably right.

652
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:27,548
No!

653
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:30,676
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

654
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:34,846
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

655
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,806
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

656
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:38,558
Let them fuel your actions.

657
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,727
Let hate be your ally,

658
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:44,564
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

659
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,903
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

660
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:55,407
What?

661
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:03,748
Where is that boy?

662
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:09,128
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

663
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:16,426
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

664
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:18,803
Now, what did you find?

665
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,640
Yes. Yes, I see.

666
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:25,893
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

667
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:29,355
That plus my stick must mean...

668
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:42,617
To the future! Shotgun!

669
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:51,959
I don't even know what I'm doing.

670
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:53,126
Keep moving forward.

671
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,295
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

672
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,504
Keep moving forward.

673
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,715
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

674
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,966
Keep moving forward.

675
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,592
Why do you keep saying that?

676
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,678
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

677
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,137
It's my dad's motto.

678
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,223
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

679
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:08,682
It's what he does.

680
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,476
What's that supposed to mean?

681
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,477
That is an excellent question.

682
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:13,979
Robinson Industries,

683
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,815
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

684
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,734
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

685
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:24,030
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

686
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,865
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

687
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,867
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

688
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,744
Your dad invented the time machine?

689
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,329
Yep. Five years ago,

690
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,623
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

691
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:37,667
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

692
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,211
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

693
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:42,005
We're talking prototypes.

694
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,506
That's a prototype?

695
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,842
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

696
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:49,178
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

697
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:51,180
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

698
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:52,556
Number six, 58,

699
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:54,099
212, 485,

700
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:55,350
952,

701
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,727
and they all end the same way.

702
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:02,690
But he doesn't give up.

703
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,444
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

704
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:09,822
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

705
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,532
the first working time machine.

706
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,993
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

707
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,203
the second working time machine.

708
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,537
Kind of small.

709
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:19,789
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

710
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,374
This, my friend, is merely a model

711
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,418
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

712
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:28,130
<i>is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.</i>

713
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,389
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

714
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,974
Now, are you ready to start working?

715
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,531
I think that's it. I did it!

716
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:58,074
I knew you could.

717
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,746
Nice work, my friend.

718
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:17,801
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

719
00:43:17,926 --> 00:43:19,469
Don't say it!

720
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,351
<i>Boys! Dinner time!</i>

721
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:28,644
Not now, Mom!

722
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:32,397
<i>If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!</i>

723
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:36,359
We'd better get up there.

724
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,448
Let's get that boy!

725
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:44,575
Sit here?

726
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,369
But I want to look, too.

727
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:50,247
A mini-Doris!

728
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:53,583
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

729
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,545
Let's take her out for a spin.

730
00:43:57,962 --> 00:43:59,422
Sorry.

731
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:02,050
Teamwork.

732
00:44:05,094 --> 00:44:06,262
<i>Sorry.</i>

733
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:08,973
<i>Sorry!</i>

734
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:15,979
There you are.

735
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:19,732
Now, to lure him out of the house.

736
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,196
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

737
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:28,490
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

738
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,492
<i>Oh! I know!</i>

739
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:34,496
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

740
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:37,749
I don't know how to do that.

741
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:40,668
I don't really need a duck.

742
00:44:42,754 --> 00:44:45,214
This may be harder than I thought.

743
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:49,927
Hey, ring my doorbell.

744
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:51,845
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

745
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,722
That doorbell will give you a rash.

746
00:44:54,848 --> 00:44:56,766
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

747
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:58,476
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

748
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,770
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

749
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:02,688
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

750
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:06,275
<i>I don't believe in fretting or grieving</i>

751
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,485
<i>Why mess around with strife?</i>

752
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:12,447
<i>Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out</i>

753
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:13,865
<i>Give me the simple life</i>

754
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:17,911
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

755
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:20,580
Dinner is served.

756
00:45:20,705 --> 00:45:21,748
Dinner is served.

757
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,293
Hooray! Italian food.

758
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:27,837
I want a sloppy joe!

759
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:30,214
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

760
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:31,548
Coming to you, big girl.

761
00:45:31,673 --> 00:45:35,385
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

762
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,387
on the black moon of Keward.

763
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:40,223
Where's my sloppy joe?

764
00:45:40,348 --> 00:45:41,766
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

765
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:44,143
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

766
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:47,021
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

767
00:45:47,146 --> 00:45:50,899
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

768
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:52,109
Temporary setback.

769
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,027
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

770
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:55,237
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

771
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:56,738
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

772
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,906
- Shiatsu?
- No.

773
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,157
- Feng shui.
- No.

774
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:00,575
I've got it under control.

775
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:04,203
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

776
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,413
- No.
- Yes.

777
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:06,622
- Yes.
- No.

778
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:08,123
Well, yes and no.

779
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:11,043
Lewis is a new transfer student.

780
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,419
Yeah.

781
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:15,046
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

782
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,675
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

783
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,511
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

784
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:24,096
- It's a big country.
- State.

785
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:26,974
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

786
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,392
Oh, good idea.

787
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:31,019
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

788
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:34,481
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

789
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:36,107
Oh, nonsense.

790
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:39,152
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

791
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:40,612
Let's see the cowlick!

792
00:46:40,737 --> 00:46:42,155
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

793
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,489
Lewis, do you mind?

794
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,950
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

795
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,493
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

796
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:48,702
Now, don't be shy.

797
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:51,330
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

798
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:59,129
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

799
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:04,133
Impressive, little sister.

800
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,927
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

801
00:47:07,052 --> 00:47:09,346
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

802
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:13,016
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

803
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,528
Your meatballs are useless against me.

804
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:29,239
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

805
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:30,532
No!

806
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,502
That's right. I did it.

807
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,212
Is dinner like this every night?

808
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:46,130
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

809
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,054
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

810
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:58,516
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

811
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:01,644
Hey, that's just like...

812
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:06,982
Stupid...

813
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:08,275
Carl?

814
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,443
Is everything all right?

815
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:13,155
We're just experiencing bugs.

816
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:16,575
Just what the doctor ordered.

817
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,577
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

818
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:21,245
Wilbur, you know I can't.

819
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:23,122
Come on. Give it a try.

820
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,875
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

821
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,627
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

822
00:48:29,503 --> 00:48:31,630
We're past the point of no return!

823
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:33,924
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

824
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:35,759
We all pay!

825
00:48:36,384 --> 00:48:37,427
I don't know.

826
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:39,596
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

827
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:40,888
Please.

828
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:47,311
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

829
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:50,689
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

830
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:53,567
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

831
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:55,527
All right, you bozos.

832
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:58,446
<i>Have to get that boy out of the house.</i>

833
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,366
<i>Sorry. Wait!</i>

834
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:03,743
<i>So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?</i>

835
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:07,121
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

836
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:09,957
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

837
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:12,543
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

838
00:49:13,794 --> 00:49:16,129
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

839
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:17,797
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

840
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:29,475
That's a good buzz. What the...

841
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,186
Yes! You are now under my control.

842
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:35,397
I am now under your control.

843
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:39,984
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

844
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:43,029
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

845
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:44,989
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

846
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:47,992
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

847
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:50,577
No.

848
00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:52,913
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

849
00:49:54,081 --> 00:49:57,751
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

850
00:49:57,876 --> 00:49:59,878
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

851
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,213
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

852
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,008
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

853
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,968
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

854
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:09,762
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

855
00:50:11,763 --> 00:50:15,433
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

856
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:19,771
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

857
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,065
and I have little arms.

858
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:26,027
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

859
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:30,823
Master?

860
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:33,867
<i>Master?</i>

861
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,454
Okay, that should do it.

862
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:40,373
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

863
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:43,251
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

864
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:44,669
Everybody ready?

865
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:46,545
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

866
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:51,133
Is it gonna work?

867
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:52,509
Oh, no!

868
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,014
No!

869
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,559
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

870
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,145
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

871
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,522
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

872
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,524
I've seen better.

873
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:12,486
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

874
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,363
If I gave up every time I failed,

875
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,406
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

876
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,992
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

877
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:22,745
Still working out the kinks.

878
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,122
Like my husband always says...

879
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,214
<i>Keep moving
Keep moving</i>

880
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:35,382
<i>Stop</i>

881
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:43,598
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

882
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:46,100
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

883
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:47,935
Something that won't talk back.

884
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,229
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

885
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:51,813
Oh, my noggin.

886
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:54,274
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

887
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,401
You're gonna regret this!

888
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,739
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

889
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,368
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

890
00:52:05,618 --> 00:52:07,786
No, I'll make it a surprise.

891
00:52:14,418 --> 00:52:16,086
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

892
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:20,006
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

893
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:22,675
May it lead to success in the future.

894
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,469
Gosh, you're all so nice.

895
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:28,389
If I had a family, I...

896
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:31,475
I'd want them to be just like you.

897
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,311
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

898
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:36,021
To Lewis!

899
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:37,147
To Lewis!

900
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:38,440
Yeah!

901
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:41,484
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

902
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,654
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

903
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:45,988
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

904
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:48,449
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

905
00:52:51,743 --> 00:52:54,204
What did he mean, if he had a family?

906
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:55,705
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

907
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:57,165
Orphan?

908
00:53:10,594 --> 00:53:12,387
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

909
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,015
Get up, you pansy!

910
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,433
What a great plan!

911
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:20,853
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

912
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:24,148
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

913
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:25,316
Because we don't.

914
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:27,568
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

915
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:32,489
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

916
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:34,241
<i>I need him alive.</i>

917
00:53:36,284 --> 00:53:37,702
Choo-chew on this!

918
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:42,874
Lewis!

919
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:51,507
Ready, aim, fire!

920
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,683
Got you!

921
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:06,353
You messed with the wrong family!

922
00:54:13,985 --> 00:54:15,779
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

923
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:21,868
No!

924
00:54:23,953 --> 00:54:26,956
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

925
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,959
Run!

926
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:34,713
Oh! He ate Carl!

927
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,300
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

928
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:52,563
Oh, no.

929
00:54:58,735 --> 00:54:59,986
Incoming!

930
00:55:01,279 --> 00:55:02,405
Run!

931
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:06,409
Now, go get that boy!

932
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,509
<i>What's going on?</i>

933
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:26,719
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

934
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:28,053
I have a big head...

935
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:29,888
...and little arms.

936
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:31,473
I'm just not sure...

937
00:55:31,598 --> 00:55:33,433
...how well this plan was
thought through.

938
00:55:36,019 --> 00:55:37,395
Master?

939
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,732
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

940
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:45,945
Bowler Hat Guy!

941
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,446
Him you can eat.

942
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:49,948
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

943
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:09,216
No!

944
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:32,112
Oh, no!

945
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,491
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

946
00:56:41,412 --> 00:56:43,831
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

947
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:45,499
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

948
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:47,293
Yeah, guess we did.

949
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,129
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

950
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:52,005
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

951
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,466
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

952
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:59,095
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

953
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,805
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

954
00:57:03,975 --> 00:57:05,768
I'm really happy you're safe.

955
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,728
- Your head.
- What?

956
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,314
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

957
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,110
You all sacrificed so much for me.

958
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:18,196
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

959
00:57:18,321 --> 00:57:19,531
One of a kind.

960
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:22,909
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

961
00:57:23,034 --> 00:57:26,203
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

962
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:28,872
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

963
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:30,874
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

964
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:33,919
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

965
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:39,507
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

966
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:43,094
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

967
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:45,096
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

968
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:49,183
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

969
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:52,352
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

970
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,980
- We really have to go.
- No.

971
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,942
No, you don't. You have to stay.

972
00:57:59,692 --> 00:58:03,237
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

973
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,614
What do you say, Lewis?

974
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:08,158
Do you want to be a Robinson?

975
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,789
You want to adopt me?

976
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:25,257
- Yeah!
- Yes!

977
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:36,726
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

978
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:38,019
Now you know the big secret.

979
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:42,273
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

980
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:44,275
That is an excellent question.

981
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,901
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

982
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:47,403
He was just being a good friend.

983
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:51,657
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

984
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:53,200
What? You just said...

985
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,202
I know what I said.

986
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:57,287
I'm from the past. So what?

987
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,957
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

988
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,209
You're a great kid,

989
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:06,253
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

990
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:11,216
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

991
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:17,472
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

992
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:21,142
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

993
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:24,228
which kind of explains the dino.

994
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,818
I'm calling your father.

995
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,486
Wait. If I have to leave,

996
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,821
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

997
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,656
Wilbur promised.

998
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:37,991
You promised what?

999
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,951
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

1000
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,995
- You lied to me?
- No!

1001
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,373
Yes.

1002
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,041
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1003
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,669
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1004
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,671
I am your friend!

1005
00:59:52,796 --> 00:59:56,341
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1006
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:21,197
<i>Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.</i>

1007
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:26,410
<i>All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,</i>

1008
01:00:27,328 --> 01:00:31,874
<i>but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.</i>

1009
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:35,836
<i>Too bad
we don't have a time machine.</i>

1010
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:39,422
<i>Oh, wait. We do.</i>

1011
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:41,341
Bowler Hat Guy?

1012
01:00:41,716 --> 01:00:44,510
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1013
01:00:44,635 --> 01:00:47,304
To make your dream come true.

1014
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:50,557
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1015
01:00:50,682 --> 01:00:53,185
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1016
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:55,145
Lewis!

1017
01:00:56,104 --> 01:00:58,523
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1018
01:00:58,648 --> 01:01:00,358
I know you're around here somewhere.

1019
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:04,195
Lewis!

1020
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:28,842
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1021
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:31,261
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1022
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:33,472
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1023
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:35,307
It doesn't work. Never did.

1024
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:36,474
Well, supposing it did,

1025
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,435
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1026
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,604
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1027
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:43,397
where might one find the "On" switch?

1028
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:45,566
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1029
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:47,860
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1030
01:01:47,985 --> 01:01:49,611
then push this red button,

1031
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:51,071
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1032
01:01:51,196 --> 01:01:52,531
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1033
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:54,699
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1034
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:56,201
Yes, of course.

1035
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:57,535
Doris?

1036
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:01,414
We had a deal!

1037
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:03,416
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1038
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:06,085
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1039
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,170
You still haven't figured it out?

1040
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:09,630
Figured out what?

1041
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:11,757
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1042
01:02:11,882 --> 01:02:14,259
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1043
01:02:14,384 --> 01:02:15,886
"Keep moving forward"?

1044
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:18,471
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1045
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,810
Are you saying

1046
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:27,354
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1047
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:30,107
Give the boy a prize.

1048
01:02:30,732 --> 01:02:34,194
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1049
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,946
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1050
01:02:36,071 --> 01:02:39,115
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1051
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:41,451
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1052
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:42,618
Keep going.

1053
01:02:43,161 --> 01:02:44,954
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1054
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,747
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1055
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:49,541
But what does that have to do
with you?

1056
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:53,545
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1057
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,882
My old room!

1058
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,385
I think you mean our old room.

1059
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,554
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1060
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,972
Mike Yagoobian!

1061
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,310
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1062
01:03:09,435 --> 01:03:10,853
How did you end up like this?

1063
01:03:10,978 --> 01:03:15,774
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1064
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:18,526
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1065
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:25,408
<i>a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.</i>

1066
01:03:25,825 --> 01:03:28,702
<i>We lost by one run because of me.</i>

1067
01:03:28,827 --> 01:03:29,912
Get him!

1068
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:34,082
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1069
01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:36,251
And we would have won!

1070
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:37,919
Do you understand?

1071
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:40,672
<i>For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.</i>

1072
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:43,925
<i>Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.</i>

1073
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,761
<i>This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.</i>

1074
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:49,471
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1075
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:51,557
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1076
01:03:51,682 --> 01:03:53,600
<i>They all hated me.</i>

1077
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:57,270
<i>Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,</i>

1078
01:03:57,395 --> 01:03:59,022
<i>except me.</i>

1079
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:01,065
<i>Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.</i>

1080
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,400
<i>- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,</i>

1081
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:04,527
<i>- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!</i>

1082
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:07,738
<i>- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...</i>

1083
01:04:07,863 --> 01:04:13,035
<i>It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.</i>

1084
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,536
<i>It was yours.</i>

1085
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:17,872
<i>If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,</i>

1086
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:20,041
<i>then I wouldn't have missed the catch,</i>

1087
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:24,212
<i>so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.</i>

1088
01:04:27,006 --> 01:04:29,717
Robinson, you stink!

1089
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:34,388
<i>Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,</i>

1090
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,265
<i>I met her.</i>

1091
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,603
<i>We retreated to our villainous lair,</i>

1092
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:45,856
<i>where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.</i>

1093
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:49,401
<i>Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,</i>

1094
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:51,737
<i>a slave to humankind,</i>

1095
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:58,910
<i>but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.</i>

1096
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:07,001
<i>However, you didn't see
her true potential.</i>

1097
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:09,128
<i>- Got it.
- So you shut her down,</i>

1098
01:05:15,759 --> 01:05:17,761
<i>or so you thought.</i>

1099
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:29,605
<i>We both had a score
to settle with you,</i>

1100
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:35,402
<i>and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...</i>

1101
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:37,362
<i>Well, we went with Doris',</i>

1102
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:42,075
<i>but I made
a very, very important contribution.</i>

1103
01:05:42,075 --> 01:05:44,660
<i>Together we made the perfect team.</i>

1104
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:55,837
Wilbur!

1105
01:05:55,962 --> 01:05:58,631
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1106
01:05:58,757 --> 01:05:59,883
Yeah, Mom.

1107
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:05,971
<i>I went to your house,
snuck in the garage</i>

1108
01:06:06,097 --> 01:06:07,848
<i>and stole the time machine,</i>

1109
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:15,814
<i>all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.</i>

1110
01:06:20,151 --> 01:06:23,196
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1111
01:06:23,321 --> 01:06:26,073
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1112
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:28,576
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1113
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:31,828
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1114
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,580
Goob, I had no idea.

1115
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:35,582
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1116
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:38,376
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1117
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,878
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1118
01:06:41,004 --> 01:06:43,089
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1119
01:06:43,214 --> 01:06:46,926
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1120
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:50,804
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1121
01:06:50,929 --> 01:06:51,972
Let's see.

1122
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:54,975
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1123
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,895
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1124
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:05,651
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1125
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,037
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1126
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:25,336
No!

1127
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:31,008
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1128
01:07:33,343 --> 01:07:34,845
But...

1129
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,972
I bet you're glad to see me.

1130
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:40,183
That's for not locking the garage door.

1131
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:42,852
You know about that?

1132
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:44,353
I know everything.

1133
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:45,479
You gotta admit,

1134
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,731
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1135
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,195
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1136
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,704
Oh, no!

1137
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,208
Take a good look around, boys,

1138
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,044
because your future
is about to change.

1139
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,214
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1140
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,424
No. No, I can't.

1141
01:08:23,014 --> 01:08:25,224
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1142
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:27,852
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1143
01:08:27,977 --> 01:08:30,687
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1144
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:35,859
<i>Look, I messed up.</i>

1145
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:39,070
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1146
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:40,238
but now it's up to you.

1147
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:43,741
You can do it, Dad.

1148
01:08:45,117 --> 01:08:50,247
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1149
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:55,460
Wilbur.

1150
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,797
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1151
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:15,562
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

1152
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:18,398
<i>I call it the Memory Scanner.</i>

1153
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:21,984
<i>So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?</i>

1154
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:25,488
<i>Yes. I call them Helping Hats.</i>

1155
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:30,117
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1156
01:09:32,494 --> 01:09:35,038
<i>Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.</i>

1157
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:37,957
<i>I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.</i>

1158
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,210
<i>No!</i>

1159
01:09:46,966 --> 01:09:50,469
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1160
01:09:50,844 --> 01:09:53,972
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1161
01:11:53,457 --> 01:11:56,626
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1162
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:12,307
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1163
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:22,275
Goob, stop!

1164
01:12:22,984 --> 01:12:24,068
You don't know what you're doing!

1165
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:26,278
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1166
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:27,530
She's using you, Goob,

1167
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:29,823
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1168
01:12:29,948 --> 01:12:31,742
What? What?

1169
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,541
I am never going to invent you.

1170
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:48,299
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1171
01:12:57,557 --> 01:12:58,725
Doris?

1172
01:12:59,184 --> 01:13:00,893
I thought she was my friend.

1173
01:13:33,006 --> 01:13:35,008
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1174
01:13:37,802 --> 01:13:39,304
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1175
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:40,471
Let him go.

1176
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:43,349
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1177
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:46,143
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1178
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,062
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1179
01:13:48,187 --> 01:13:49,730
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1180
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:52,065
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1181
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,608
I'll give you three good reasons.

1182
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:56,152
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1183
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:58,613
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1184
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:02,200
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1185
01:14:04,493 --> 01:14:07,663
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1186
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:09,873
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1187
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,084
Goob!

1188
01:14:14,044 --> 01:14:15,295
Goob.

1189
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,863
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1190
01:14:43,988 --> 01:14:45,573
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1191
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:47,158
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1192
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,367
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1193
01:14:48,492 --> 01:14:51,119
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1194
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:54,998
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1195
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,376
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1196
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:00,253
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1197
01:15:00,378 --> 01:15:03,881
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1198
01:15:17,519 --> 01:15:19,270
Ratted out by the old lady.

1199
01:15:20,355 --> 01:15:21,564
Harsh.

1200
01:15:26,277 --> 01:15:27,486
Okay.

1201
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:41,165
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1202
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:43,125
Yeah, no kidding.

1203
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:45,669
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1204
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:47,171
Yeah.

1205
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:52,217
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1206
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,274
It was our first real invention.

1207
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:10,692
It's the one that started it all.

1208
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:11,944
Wowie.

1209
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:16,656
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1210
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,409
Well, that depends on you.

1211
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:20,535
Nothing is set in stone.

1212
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,455
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1213
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,795
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1214
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,174
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1215
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,969
Do we ever meet her?

1216
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,099
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1217
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:47,977
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1218
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,312
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1219
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:54,483
That's because we are one smart kid.

1220
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:00,488
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1221
01:17:00,613 --> 01:17:03,115
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1222
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:05,034
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1223
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,454
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1224
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:10,330
Hey, while I got you here,

1225
01:17:10,456 --> 01:17:13,875
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1226
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,546
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1227
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:21,674
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1228
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:24,218
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1229
01:17:25,386 --> 01:17:27,846
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1230
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:30,599
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1231
01:17:30,724 --> 01:17:31,725
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1232
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,686
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1233
01:17:34,811 --> 01:17:38,189
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1234
01:17:38,314 --> 01:17:40,858
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1235
01:17:40,984 --> 01:17:43,486
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1236
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:48,490
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1237
01:17:48,616 --> 01:17:51,535
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1238
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:56,831
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1239
01:17:57,749 --> 01:17:59,042
And I am.

1240
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:01,586
Then you're absolutely right.

1241
01:18:04,171 --> 01:18:06,006
All right, I'm coming.

1242
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:08,425
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1243
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,344
They are your family, after all.

1244
01:18:40,204 --> 01:18:41,205
Wait a minute.

1245
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:43,416
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1246
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:44,709
I know.

1247
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:53,050
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1248
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:55,802
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1249
01:18:55,927 --> 01:18:57,804
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1250
01:18:57,929 --> 01:18:59,097
What?

1251
01:19:17,655 --> 01:19:19,073
A deal's a deal.

1252
01:21:22,437 --> 01:21:25,314
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1253
01:21:26,065 --> 01:21:29,234
Because I already have a family.

1254
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:42,038
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1255
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:45,207
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1256
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,043
I won't.

1257
01:21:48,168 --> 01:21:50,129
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1258
01:21:50,254 --> 01:21:51,755
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1259
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,048
till you get it right.

1260
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,926
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1261
01:21:57,052 --> 01:21:58,303
Don't forget it.

1262
01:21:58,428 --> 01:22:00,221
I don't think that's possible.

1263
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:02,890
You better get going.

1264
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:05,226
See you later, Wilbur.

1265
01:22:23,618 --> 01:22:25,161
Wait a minute!

1266
01:22:33,752 --> 01:22:35,754
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1267
01:22:35,879 --> 01:22:36,921
What?

1268
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:41,217
That's it!

1269
01:22:49,308 --> 01:22:52,102
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1270
01:22:52,227 --> 01:22:54,438
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1271
01:22:56,564 --> 01:22:59,359
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1272
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:02,653
I need a volunteer.

1273
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,616
Now, just give me a date to input.

1274
01:23:07,741 --> 01:23:09,159
Well, now, let's see.

1275
01:23:09,326 --> 01:23:12,412
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1276
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:15,665
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1277
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,001
I know.

1278
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,378
Perfect!

1279
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:35,809
<i>- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.</i>

1280
01:23:37,894 --> 01:23:39,687
Oh! It works.

1281
01:23:39,812 --> 01:23:42,273
- It works!
- It works.

1282
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:45,109
<i>You look beautiful, Lucille.</i>

1283
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:51,532
Bud?

1284
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:54,743
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1285
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:56,661
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1286
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:59,664
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1287
01:23:59,789 --> 01:24:01,165
This invention is brilliant!

1288
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,750
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1289
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:05,002
That was some show you put on.

1290
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:08,589
You're a real special kid,

1291
01:24:11,383 --> 01:24:14,594
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1292
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,430
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1293
01:24:18,598 --> 01:24:21,017
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1294
01:24:21,142 --> 01:24:22,518
No harm done.

1295
01:24:23,394 --> 01:24:25,730
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1296
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:28,190
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1297
01:24:28,315 --> 01:24:33,195
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1298
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,446
Really?

1299
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:38,283
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1300
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,827
But nobody believes me.

1301
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:43,746
They all think I'm crazy.

1302
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:47,875
You think I'm crazy, too.

1303
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,003
No. No, I think you're right.

1304
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,299
Over here? There he is.

1305
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,636
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1306
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,346
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1307
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:06,725
<i>Let it go</i>

1308
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:07,935
Yeah.

1309
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,313
<i>Let it roll right off your shoulder</i>

1310
01:25:11,438 --> 01:25:12,898
<i>Don't you know</i>

1311
01:25:14,608 --> 01:25:17,110
<i>The hardest part is over</i>

1312
01:25:17,235 --> 01:25:18,862
<i>Let it in</i>

1313
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:22,740
<i>Let your clarity define you</i>

1314
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:24,450
<i>In the end</i>

1315
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:29,913
<i>We will only just remember
How it feels</i>

1316
01:25:39,672 --> 01:25:41,716
<i>Let it slide</i>

1317
01:25:42,758 --> 01:25:45,678
<i>Let your troubles fall behind you</i>

1318
01:25:45,803 --> 01:25:47,596
<i>Let it shine</i>

1319
01:25:48,597 --> 01:25:51,266
<i>Until you feel it all around you</i>

1320
01:25:51,433 --> 01:25:54,102
<i>And I don't mind</i>

1321
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:57,063
<i>If it's me you need to turn to</i>

1322
01:25:57,188 --> 01:25:59,440
<i>We'll get by</i>

1323
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:04,445
<i>It's the heart that really matters
In the end</i>

1324
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:07,573
<i>Our lives are made</i>

1325
01:26:07,698 --> 01:26:10,409
<i>In these small hours</i>

1326
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:13,120
<i>These little wonders</i>

1327
01:26:13,286 --> 01:26:16,164
<i>These twists and turns of fate</i>

1328
01:26:16,456 --> 01:26:18,792
<i>Time falls away</i>

1329
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:22,128
<i>But these small hours</i>

1330
01:26:22,253 --> 01:26:27,591
<i>These small hours still remain</i>

1331
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:30,302
<i>All of my regret</i>

1332
01:26:30,427 --> 01:26:33,221
<i>Will wash away somehow</i>

1333
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,016
<i>But I cannot forget</i>

1334
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:39,435
<i>The way I feel right now</i>

1335
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:05,292
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1336
01:27:06,585 --> 01:27:08,629
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1337
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:11,798
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1338
01:27:13,175 --> 01:27:15,468
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1339
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:31,275
<i>The future's arrived</i>

1340
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,943
<i>Nobody can doubt</i>

1341
01:27:33,068 --> 01:27:36,154
<i>The future is what everything's about</i>

1342
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:39,073
<i>It's better for you
And it's better for me</i>

1343
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:42,577
<i>It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be</i>

1344
01:27:42,702 --> 01:27:44,662
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1345
01:27:46,122 --> 01:27:48,791
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1346
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:51,001
<i>The future's alive</i>

1347
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:52,628
<i>Alive as can be</i>

1348
01:27:52,753 --> 01:27:54,129
<i>Just open your eyes</i>

1349
01:27:54,254 --> 01:27:55,880
<i>It's plain to see</i>

1350
01:27:56,006 --> 01:27:57,465
<i>Just don't be afraid</i>

1351
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,384
<i>Just keep going on</i>

1352
01:27:59,509 --> 01:28:02,303
<i>One step at a time
And you can't go wrong</i>

1353
01:28:02,428 --> 01:28:04,972
<i>It's time to create</i>

1354
01:28:05,097 --> 01:28:07,099
<i>Time to grow</i>

1355
01:28:07,224 --> 01:28:08,726
<i>If you feel right</i>

1356
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:12,104
<i>The world, yeah
She's changing</i>

1357
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:14,856
<i>Don't it make you feel alive?</i>

1358
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:17,525
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1359
01:28:18,985 --> 01:28:21,571
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1360
01:28:22,488 --> 01:28:24,031
<i>The future's alive</i>

1361
01:28:25,574 --> 01:28:28,243
<i>The future is alive today</i>

1362
01:28:35,834 --> 01:28:38,878
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1363
01:28:39,003 --> 01:28:41,881
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1364
01:28:42,006 --> 01:28:43,591
<i>The future's arrived</i>

1365
01:28:43,716 --> 01:28:45,217
<i>Nobody can doubt</i>

1366
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:48,679
<i>The future is what everything's about</i>

1367
01:28:48,804 --> 01:28:51,807
<i>It's better for you
It's better for me</i>

1368
01:28:51,932 --> 01:28:54,810
<i>It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be</i>

1369
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:57,645
<i>It's time to create</i>

1370
01:28:57,771 --> 01:28:59,314
<i>Time to grow</i>

1371
01:28:59,606 --> 01:29:01,482
<i>If you feel right</i>

1372
01:29:01,607 --> 01:29:04,735
<i>The world, yeah
She's changing</i>

1373
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,030
