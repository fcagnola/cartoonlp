Let's see, now.

185
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,505
The last time I saw her,

186
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:11,053
she was sittin' over there
on her bed all alone.

187
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,305
She looked awful sad.

188
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,307
And so I asked her...

189
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,976
What's wrong, Penny, honey?

190
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,813
- Nothing.
- Come on now. Come on.

191
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,817
No secrets. You tell old Rufus, huh?

192
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:31,156
Well, it was adoption day
at the orphanage.

193
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,159
- What happened?
- A man and a lady came,

194
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,538
and looked at me, but they
choosed a little redheaded girl.

195
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,875
She was prettier than me.

196
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,210
Oh!

197
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,420
She couldn't be!

198
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,423
You listen to me, darlin'.

199
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,510
You're something extra special.

200
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,720
No, I'm not.

201
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,807
Why, someday a mama and a papa
will come to the orphanage

202
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,061

203
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,148
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.

204
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:09,986
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.

205
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,281

206
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,159
- Yes, I do.
- Well,

has to adopt Teddy, too.

No. It's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.

Get in what? With who?

242

my big diamond?

551
