1
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,950
Once upon a time
in a faraway land...

2
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
a young prince
lived in a shining castle.

3
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,250
Although he had everything
his heart desired...

4
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,970
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,260
But then,
one winter's night...

6
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,970
an old beggar woman
came to the castle...

7
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,980
and offered him
a single rose...

8
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,440
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,940
Repulsed by her
haggard appearance...

10
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,940
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.

11
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,490
But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances...

12
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,740
for beauty is found within.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,660
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away...

14
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,670
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

15
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,750
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,510
for she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,220
And as punishment, she transformed him
into a hideous beast...

18
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,890
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,480
Ashamed of
his monstrous form...

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,570
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle...

21
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,200
with a magic mirror as
his only window to the outside world.

22
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,570
The rose she had offered...

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,160
was truly an enchanted rose...

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,830
which would bloom
until his 21 st year.

25
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,620
If he could learn
to love another...

26
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,750
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell...

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,130
then the spell
would be broken.

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,890
If not,
he would be doomed...

29
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,470
to remain a beast
for all time.

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,640
As the years passed...

31
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,190
he fell into despair
and lost all hope...

32
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,360
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,180
Little town
It's a quiet village

34
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,150
Every day
like the one before

35
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,610
Little town
full of little people

36
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,910
Waking up to say

37
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,750
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

38
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,000
The same old
bread and rolls to sell

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
Every morning
just the same

40
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,800
Since the morning
that we came

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,420
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.

42
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,380
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?

43
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,640
The bookshop. I just finished
the most wonderful story...

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,180
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,560
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!

46
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,060
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

47
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,530
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell

48
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,240
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud

49
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,530
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

50
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,540
- Bonjour
- Good day

51
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,250
How is your family

52
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,370
- Bonjour
- Good day

53
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,080
How is your wife

54
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,590
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive

55
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,800
There must be more
than this provincial life

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,260
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.

57
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,220
- I've come to return
the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,890
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

59
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,770
Not since yesterday.

60
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,230
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.

61
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,770
That one?
But you've read it twice!

62
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,980
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places...

63
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,240
daring sword fights, magic spells,
a prince in disguise.

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,490
If you like it all that much,
it's yours.

65
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,200
- But, sir!
- I insist.

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,370
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,080
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,420
I wonder if
she's feeling well

69
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,920
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book

70
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,050
What a puzzle
to the rest of us is Belle

71
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,640
Oh

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,270
Isn't this amazing

73
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,850
It's my favourite part

74
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,570
Because you'll see

75
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,740
Here's where
she meets Prince Charming

76
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,910
But she won't
discover that it's him

77
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,370
Till chapter three

78
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,880
Now it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,090
Her looks have got
no parallel

81
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,840
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

82
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,760
Very different
from the rest of us

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
She's nothing like the rest of us

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,560
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,440
Wow! You didn't
miss a shot, Gaston!

86
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,320
- You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!
- I know.

87
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,860
No beast alive stands
a chance against you...

88
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,820
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.

89
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,370
And I've got my sights
set on that one.

90
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,830
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!

91
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,120
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...

92
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,380
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...

93
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,840
That makes her the best!

94
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,670
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!

95
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,140
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,640
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

97
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,970
I said she's gorgeous
and I fell

98
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,020
Here in town
there's only she

99
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,850
Who is beautiful as me

100
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,980
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,940
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy

102
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,150
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,780
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing

104
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,330
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

105
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,540
- Bonjour
- Good day

106
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes

107
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,920
- Some cheese
- Ten yards

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,170
- Excuse me
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through

109
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,460
- This bread, it's stale
- Those fish, they smell
- Madame's mistaken

110
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,300
There must be more than
this provincial life

111
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,510
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,810
Look, there she goes, a girl
who's strange but special

113
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,150
A most peculiar
mademoiselle

114
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,650
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

115
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,070
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

116
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:16,740
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

117
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,910
That Belle

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,960
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.

119
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,050
Gaston, may I have
my book, please?

120
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,670
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,050
Well, some people
use their imagination.

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,760
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books...

123
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,520
and paid attention
to more important things.

124
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,270
Like me.

125
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,020
The whole town's
talking about it.

126
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,110
It's not right
for a woman to read.

127
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,900
Soon she starts
getting ideas and thinking.

128
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,160
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.

129
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,490
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern...

130
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,580
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.

131
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,080
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crazy.
- He's gorgeous!

132
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,750
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

133
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,380
Goodbye.

134
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,260
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.

135
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,380
Don't talk about
my father that way!

136
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,050
Yeah! Don't talk about
her father that way!

137
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,470
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!

138
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,410
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?

139
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,160
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,580
I-I'm a... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

141
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,750
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!

142
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,170
Yes, you will, and you'll win
first prize at the fair tomorrow.

144
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,340
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.

145
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,140
- You really believe that?
- I always have.

146
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,560
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,810
Hand me that... the... the...
the dog-legged clincher there.

148
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,730
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

149
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,110
I got a new book.

150
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,160
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

151
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
My daughter? Odd?

152
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,370
Where would you get
an idea like that?

153
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,790
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here.

154
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,870
There's no one I can really talk to.

155
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,460
What about that Gaston?
H-He's a handsome fella.

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,260
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

157
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,340
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...

158
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,270
'cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

159
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,270
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

160
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,290
- It works!
- It does?

161
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,410
- It does!
- You did it!

162
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,420
You really did it!

163
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,750
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!

164
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,050
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!

165
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,220
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

166
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,110
We should be there by now.

167
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,110
We should be there by now.

168
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
Maybe we missed a turn.

169
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,740
I guess I should have taken...
Wait a minute.

170
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,170
No. Let's go this way.

171
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,430
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.

172
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,540
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

173
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,330
We better turn around.

174
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,710
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

175
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!

176
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,260
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!

177
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,770
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!

178
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,850
Back up, back up, back up!

179
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,650
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

180
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,360
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.

181
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,200
Steady. No, Philippe!

182
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,620
Philippe?

183
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,080
Oh.

184
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,360
Help!
Is... Is someone there?

185
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,940
Help!

186
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,070
Oh!

187
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,270
Wha... Oh!

188
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,610
Hello?

189
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,230
Hello!

190
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,650
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.

191
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,780
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.

192
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,910
Is someone there?

193
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,620
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!

194
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,000
I-I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse...

195
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,960
and... and I need a place
to stay for the night.

196
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,170
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

197
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,590
Shh!

198
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,010
O-O-Ow! Ow! Ow!

199
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,300
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

200
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,930
Who said that?

201
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,930
Over here.

202
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,100
- Where?
- Hello.

203
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,360
Incredible!

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,270
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

205
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,150
Splendid! Just peachy!

206
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,610
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!

207
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,280
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!

208
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,080
Sir, close that at once!

209
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,540
- Do you mind?
- I-I beg your pardon?

210
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,960
It's... It's just that I've
never seen a clock that...

211
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,560
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur.

212
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,730
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.

213
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,190
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!

214
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,320
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

215
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,990
I demand that you stop
right there!

216
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,450
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!

217
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,320
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!

218
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,290
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!

219
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,040
Well, hello there, boy.

220
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,550
- Oh, what service!
- All right!

221
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,880
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

222
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,850
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.

223
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,180
No! No tea. No tea!

224
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,350
His mustache tickles, Mama!

225
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,730
Oh! Hello!

226
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,610
Uh-oh.

227
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,370
There's a stranger here.

228
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,670
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

229
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,000
He was cold and wet, so...

230
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,510
Master, I would like to take
this moment to say...

231
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,800
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

232
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,020
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

233
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,440
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

234
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,940
I-I-I was lost in the woods and...

235
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,110
- You are not welcome here!
- I-I-I'm sorry.

236
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,320
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.

237
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,080
So, you've come to stare
at the beast, have you?

238
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,580
Please, I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay.

239
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,590
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!

240
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,680
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

241
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Yep, this is her lucky day.

242
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,770
I would like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

243
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,440
First I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

244
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,490
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...

245
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, I know! I know!
I-I strike up the band!

246
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,450
- Not yet!
- Sorry.

247
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh!

248
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,180
Gaston,
what a pleasant surprise.

249
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,600
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

250
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,060
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town who
wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

251
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,730
This is the day...

252
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,610
This is the day
your dreams come true.

253
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,320
This is the day
your dreams come true.

254
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,280
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

255
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,620
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.

256
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,870
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire...

257
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,000
and my little wife
massaging my feet...

258
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,920
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,210
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?

260
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,840
No, Belle.

261
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,430
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.

262
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,220
- Do you know who that
little wife will be?
- Let me think.

263
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,430
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...

264
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,970
I'm speechless.

265
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,520
I really don't know
what to say.

266
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,730
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

267
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,860
but I just don't deserve you!

268
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,420
So, how would it go?

269
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,460
I'll have Belle for my wife.

270
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,590
Make no mistake about that.

271
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,720
Touchy!

272
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,650
Is he gone?

273
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,900
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

274
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,320
Me, the wife of that
boorish, brainless...

275
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,280
Madame Gaston

276
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
Can't you just see it

277
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,910
Madame Gaston
his little wife

278
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,660
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it

279
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,670
I want much more than
this provincial life

280
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,710
I want much more than
this provincial life

281
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,310
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

282
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,940
I want it more
than I can tell

283
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,360
And for once
it might be grand

284
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,610
To have someone understand

285
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,370
I want so much more
than they've got planned

286
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,370
Philippe! What are you
doing here? Where's...

287
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,000
Philippe! What are you
doing here? Where's...

288
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,750
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

289
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,090
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

290
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,360
What is this place?

291
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,820
Philippe, please, steady.

292
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,740
Steady.

293
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,780
Papa!

294
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,700
Couldn't keep quiet,
could we?

295
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,290
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

296
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,540
Serve him tea,
sit in the master's chair.

297
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,550
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.

298
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,090
Hello?
Is anyone here?

299
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,600
Hello?

300
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,020
Papa? Papa?

301
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,180
Are you here?

302
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,190
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

303
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,440
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

304
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,860
Really, Mama.
I saw her.

305
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,030
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...

306
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,820
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!

307
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,740
See, I told ya!

308
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,040
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy eared, slack-jawed...

309
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,670
Papa?

310
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,210
Did you see that?

311
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,380
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.

312
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!

313
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,600
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

314
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,140
Papa?

315
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,440
Papa?

316
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,440
Hello?
Is someone here?

317
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,860
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. I...

318
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,540
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

319
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,330
I-Is anyone here?

320
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,290
- Belle?
- Papa!

321
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,550
- H-H-How did you find me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.

322
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,720
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.

323
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,260
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.

324
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,760
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.

325
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,890
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!

326
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,520
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.

327
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,440
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.

328
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,860
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!

329
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,820
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

330
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,910
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

331
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,330
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!

332
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,590
- Take me instead.
- You?

333
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,800
You would take his place?

334
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,090
Belle, no! You don't know
what you're doing!

335
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,050
If I did,
would you let him go?

336
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,680
Yes, but you must promise
to stay here forever.

337
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,020
Come into the light.

338
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,700
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!

339
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,040
- You have my word.
- Done!

340
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,300
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

341
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,470
- Wait!
- Belle!
- Wait!

342
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,810
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!

343
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,310
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

344
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,980
Let me out.
Please let me out!

345
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,230
Let me out!
Please! Please!

346
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,410
- Master?
- What?

347
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,540
Uh, since the girl is going to be
with us for quite some time...

348
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,330
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

349
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,540
Then again, maybe not.

350
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,970
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.

351
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,260
I'll never see him again.

352
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,060
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.

353
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,680
My room?
But I thought...

354
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,810
- You wanna... You wanna
stay in the tower?
- No.

355
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,310
Then follow me.

356
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,960
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.

357
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,510
I, uh, hope you like it here.

358
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,060
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like
except the west wing.

359
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,890
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!

360
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,150
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

361
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,860
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

362
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,990
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

363
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,470
Who does she think she is? That girl
has tangled with the wrong man.

364
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,560
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!

365
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,940
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!

366
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,820
Why, it's more
than I can bear.

367
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,400
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.

368
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,530
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!

369
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,040
Gaston, you've got to
pull yourself together.

370
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,250
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

371
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,290
Looking so
down in the dumps

372
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,500
Every guy here would
love to be you, Gaston

373
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,800
Even when taking
your lumps

374
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,050
There's no man in town
as admired as you

375
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,560
You're every one's
favourite guy

376
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
Every one's awed
and inspired by you

377
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,980
And it's not very hard

378
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,610
To see why

379
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,570
No one's

380
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,780
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston

381
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,990
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston

382
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,910
For there's no man in town
half as manly

383
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,500
Perfect
A pure paragon

384
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,960
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley

385
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,220
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on

386
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,470
No one's

387
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,560
Been like Gaston
a kingpin like Gaston

388
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,680
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

389
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,520
As a specimen
yes, I'm intimidating

390
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,690
My, what a guy
that Gaston

391
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,070
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

392
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,450
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

393
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,620
No one

394
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,580
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston

395
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,880
In a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston

396
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,340
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

397
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,590
As you see
I've got biceps to spare

398
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,550
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!

399
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,850
And every last inch of me is
covered with hair

400
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,680
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston

401
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,020
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

402
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,150
I'm especially good at expectorating

403
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,070
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston

404
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,110
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs

405
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,660
Every morning
to help me get large

406
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,830
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

407
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:22,840
So I'm roughly the size
of a barge

408
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,340
No one

409
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,920
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston

410
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,630
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston

411
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,930
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

412
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,850
I use antlers in all
of my decorating

413
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,390
My, what a guy

414
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,150
Gaston

415
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,450
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?

416
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,740
Please! Please, I need your help.

417
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,240
He's got her... He's got her
locked in the dungeon!

418
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,370
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.

419
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,250
Not... Not a minute to lose.

420
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,580
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

421
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,670
Who's got Belle
locked in a dungeon?

422
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,670
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!

423
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,510
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!

424
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,770
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!

425
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,600
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?

426
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,980
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.

427
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,030
You will? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

428
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,900
You will? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

429
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,450
Crazy old Maurice.

430
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,160
He's always good
for a laugh.

431
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,160
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

432
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,500
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.

433
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,250
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

434
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,590
- A dangerous pastime
- I know

435
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,640
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

436
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,760
And his sanity's
only so-so

437
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,140
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

438
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,270
Since I looked at
that loony old man

439
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,060
See, I promised myself
I would be married to Belle

440
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,820
See, I promised myself
I would be married to Belle

441
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,150
And right now
I'm evolving a plan

442
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,610
- If I...
- Yes?

443
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,700
- Then we...
- No, would she?

444
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,330
- Guess!
- Now I get it!

445
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,660
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

446
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,460
No one

447
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,590
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

448
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,840
Plans to persecute harmless
crackpots like Gaston

449
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,590
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

450
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,970
My, what a guy

451
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,230
Gaston

452
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,020
Will no one help me?

453
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,450
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.

454
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,540
I thought you might like
a spot of tea.

455
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,790
But you're...
You're a...

456
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,460
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!

457
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,210
I know it is,
but here we are.

458
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,050
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

459
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,390
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.

460
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,140
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.

461
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,270
Wanna see me
do a trick?

462
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,770
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.

463
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,360
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

464
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,650
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father...

465
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,660
my dreams, everything.

466
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,660
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

467
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,080
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me...

468
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,670
jabbering on while there's
a supper to get on the table.

469
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,000
- Chip?
- Bye!

470
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,800
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

471
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,510
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.

472
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,390
Oh, how embarrassing!

473
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,100
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!

474
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,100
You'll look ravishing
in this one!

475
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,640
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

476
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,270
Ah, but you must!

477
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,770
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.

478
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,690
Dinner is served.

479
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,370
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.

480
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,040
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.

481
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,500
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

482
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Master, have you thought
that perhaps...

483
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,880
this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

484
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,710
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.

485
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,590
Good!
So, you fall in love with her...

486
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,090
she falls in love with you,
and poof!

487
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,180
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.

488
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,230
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

489
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,390
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

490
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,810
Oh, it's no use.

491
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,440
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!

492
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,740
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

493
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,910
I don't know how.

494
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,700
Well, you can start by
making yourself more presentable.

495
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,750
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

496
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,000
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

497
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,630
Come, come.
Show me the smile.

498
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,470
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.

499
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,010
But be gentle.

500
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,050
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.

501
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,600
And above all,
you must control your temper!

502
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,480
Here she is!

503
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,350
Good evening.

504
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Well, where is she?

505
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,150
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.

506
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,200
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

507
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,330
Circumstances
being what they are...

508
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,700
Uh, she's not coming.

509
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,500
What!

510
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,790
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!

511
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,630
Let's not be hasty!

512
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,180
- I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.

513
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,680
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

514
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,680
Master, I could be wrong,
but that may not be...

515
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,100
the best way to win
the girl's affections.

516
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,690
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

517
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,530
But she is being so difficult.

518
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,610
Gently, gently.

519
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,370
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!

520
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,830
Suave, genteel.

521
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,960
It would give me
great pleasure...

522
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
if you would
join me for dinner.

523
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,090
And we say please.

524
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,630
- Please.
- No, thank you.

525
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,840
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.

526
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,590
Fine! Then go ahead
and starve!

527
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,220
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

528
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh, dear. That didn't
go very well at all, did it?

529
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,730
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door...

530
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,900
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

531
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,360
You can count on me,
mon capitaine.

532
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,330
Well, we might as well
go downstairs and start cleaning up.

533
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,960
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

534
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,630
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?

535
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,170
Show me the girl.

536
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,380
But the master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.

537
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,220
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.

538
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:31,970
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.

539
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,100
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.

540
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,060
I'm just fooling myself.

541
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,560
She'll never see me
as anything...

542
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,190
but a monster.

543
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,820
It's hopeless.

544
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,220
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

545
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,010
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

546
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,720
I've been burnt by you before.

547
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,560
Zut alors!
She has emerged!

548
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,480
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

549
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,900
But I'm not sleepy.

550
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,160
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

551
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,450
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

552
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,580
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste!

553
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,830
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

554
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,050
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn!

555
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,760
After all, he did say please.

556
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,300
But if the master
doesn't learn to control that temper,
he'll never break the...

557
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,720
Splendid to see you
out and about, mademoiselle.

558
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,140
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

559
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,810
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchant�, ch�rie.

560
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,570
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do...

561
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,400
to make your stay
more comfortable...

562
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,780
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?

563
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,490
Hear that?
She's hungry!

564
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,700
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.

565
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,160
Remember what
the master said.

566
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,540
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

567
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,590
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

568
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,050
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!

569
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,760
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!

570
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,590
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.

571
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,550
Well, keep it down.

572
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,020
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

573
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,140
Of course, of course.

574
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,690
But what is dinner
without a little music?

575
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,110
Music?

576
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,320
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

577
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,240
that we welcome you tonight.

578
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,620
And now
we invite you to relax.

579
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,950
And now
we invite you to relax.

580
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,910
Let us pull up a chair
as the dining room proudly presents...

581
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,620
your dinner.

582
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,500
Be our guest

583
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,920
Be our guest
Put our service to the test

584
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,640
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, ch�rie
and we provide the rest

585
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,060
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres

586
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,270
Why, we only live to serve

587
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,600
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious

588
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,900
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes

589
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,190
They can sing
They can dance

590
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,650
After all, miss
this is France

591
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,530
And a dinner here
is never second best

592
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,990
Go on, unfold your menu

593
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,200
Take a glance and then
you'll be our guest

594
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,500
Oui, our guest
Be our guest

595
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,880
Beef ragout, cheese souffl�
Pie and pudding en flamb�

596
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,130
We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret

597
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,550
You're alone and you're scared
but the banquet's all prepared

598
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,850
No one's gloomy
or complaining

599
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,180
While the flatware's entertaining

600
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,270
We tell jokes, I do tricks
with my fellow candlesticks

601
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,190
Und it's all in perfect taste
that you can bet

602
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,490
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass

603
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,820
To be our guest
if you're stressed

604
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,820
It's fine dining
we suggest

605
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,700
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest

606
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,580
Life is so unnerving
for a servant who's not serving

607
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,960
He's not whole without
a soul to wait upon

608
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,760
Get off!

609
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,590
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

610
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,350
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone

611
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,390
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting

612
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,850
Needing so much more
than dusting

613
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:55,230
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills

614
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,030
Most days we just
lay around the castle

615
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,370
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy

616
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,160
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

617
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,120
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

618
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,090
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me

619
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,800
While the cups do their soft- Shoeing
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

620
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,760
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot

621
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,100
Clean it up
We want the company impressed

622
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,100
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two

623
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,440
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest

624
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,980
- She's our guest
- Be our guest

625
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,230
- Be our guest, be our guest.Our command is your request
- Let's go, people. Fun's over. Over here. Line up.

626
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,030
It's ten years since we've had
anybody here and we're obsessed

627
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,950
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

628
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,580
While the candlelight's
still glowing

629
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,870
Let us help you
We'll keep going

630
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,500
Course by course

631
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,630
One by one

632
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,470
Till you shout
Enough, I'm done

633
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,300
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest

634
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,060
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up

635
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,060
Be our guest

636
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,060
Be our guest
Be our guest

637
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,400
Please be our

638
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,610
Guest

639
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,580
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.

640
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,880
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

641
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,460
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

642
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,010
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

643
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,050
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

644
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,300
Enchanted!

645
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,560
Who said anything about
the castle being enchanted?

646
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,100
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I figured it out for myself.

647
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,480
I would like to look around,
if that's all right.

648
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,900
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

649
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,280
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

650
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,700
We can't let her go poking around in
certain places, if you know what I mean.

651
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:15,410
Perhaps you would like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.

652
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,630
Oh, well! Actually, I...

653
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,130
Yes, I do.

654
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,840
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away...

655
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,180
to reveal
the minimalist rococo design.

656
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,390
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

657
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,850
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.

658
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,810
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

659
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,360
Where was I?

660
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,650
As you were!

661
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,370
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

662
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,870
Uh, mademoiselle?

663
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,960
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.

664
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,210
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.

665
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,960
Dusty, dull, very boring.

666
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,510
Ah, so that's the west wing!

667
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,840
Nice going.

668
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,390
I wonder what
he's hiding up there.

669
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,390
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

670
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,850
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would,
uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?

671
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,650
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

672
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,940
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens...

673
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,070
or, or the...
the library perhaps?

674
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,990
You have a library?

675
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,110
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.

676
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,990
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!

677
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,330
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!

678
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,660
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!

679
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,580
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.

680
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,790
Books on every subject
ever studied...

681
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,250
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

682
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,880
By every author
who ever set pen to paper.

683
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,720
Oh, oh.

684
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,110
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

685
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:32,030
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.

686
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,200
Do you realize
what you could have done?

687
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,870
Please! Stop!

688
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,740
- Get out!
- No!

689
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,460
Get out!

690
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,390
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...

691
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,350
I can't stay here
another minute.

692
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,890
No, wait, please!
Please wait!

693
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:20,720
No!

694
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,830
Here, now. Don't do that.

695
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,880
Just hold still.

696
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,340
- That hurts!
- If you would hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

697
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,680
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

698
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,350
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

699
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,180
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

700
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,400
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

701
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,110
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.

702
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,530
By the way, thank you
for saving my life.

703
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,040
You're welcome.

704
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:25,800
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night...

705
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,720
but he said you would make it
worth my while.

706
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,390
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.

707
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,350
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

708
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,900
But she needs a little persuasion.

709
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,280
Turned him down flat!

710
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,780
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

711
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,490
He was in here tonight raving
about a beast in a castle.

712
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,120
Maurice is harmless.

713
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,330
The point is,
Belle would do anything...

714
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,620
to keep him
from being locked up.

715
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,710
Yeah, even marry him.

716
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,130
So you want me to throw her father
into the asylum...

717
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,800
unless she agrees to marry you.

718
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,640
Unless she agrees to marry you.

719
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,640
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!

720
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,270
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone!

721
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,400
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!

722
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,110
I'll find that castle
and somehow, I...

723
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,360
I'll get her out of there.

724
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,120
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.

725
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,500
Guess it's not gonna work after all.

726
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,960
They have to come back sometime.

727
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,840
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

728
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,180
Lefou, don't move from that spot...

729
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,300
until Belle
and her father come home.

730
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,600
But... But I...

731
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,100
Ah, nuts!

732
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,130
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

733
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,760
I want to do something
for her, but what?

734
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
Well, there's the usual things.

735
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,090
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

736
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:37,220
Ah, no, no, it has to be
something very special.

737
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,940
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!

738
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,070
Belle?

739
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,730
There's something
I want to show you.

740
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,860
But first,
you have to close your eyes.

741
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,160
It's a surprise.

742
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,130
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.

743
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,880
Wait here.

744
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,390
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!

745
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,490
I can't believe it!

746
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,740
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

747
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,910
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!

748
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,120
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.

749
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,250
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.

750
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,750
What? What works?

751
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,090
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?

752
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,720
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.

753
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,970
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

754
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,600
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

755
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,980
There's something sweet
and almost kind

756
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,610
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

757
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,660
And now he's dear
and so unsure

758
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,080
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before

759
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,720
She glanced this way
I thought I saw

760
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,390
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

761
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:26,350
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore

762
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,350
But then she's never looked at me
that way before

763
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,900
New and a bit alarming

764
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,620
Who would have ever thought

765
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:48,250
That this could be

766
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,460
True

767
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,340
That he's no Prince Charming

768
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,010
But there's something in him

769
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:02,510
That I simply didn't see

770
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,640
- Well, who would have thought
- Well, bless my soul

771
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
- Well, who would have known
- Well, who indeed

772
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,440
And who would have guessed
they would come together on their own

773
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,100
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see

774
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,190
A few days more

775
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,780
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

776
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,530
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

777
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,740
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

778
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,620
What?

779
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,330
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

780
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,040
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.

781
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,880
I'll tell you when you're older.

782
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,520
Tonight is the night.

783
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,990
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.

784
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,280
You must be bold, daring.

785
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,370
Bold! Daring!

786
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,620
There will be music,
romantic candlelight...

787
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,630
provided by myself.

788
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,630
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

789
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,760
Yes, I con...

790
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
I, I... No, I can't.

791
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,640
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.

792
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,390
Well, then you must tell her.

793
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:20,270
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...

794
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,310
Stupid.

795
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,610
Not quite the word
I was looking for.

796
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,400
Perhaps a little more
off the top.

797
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,830
Your lady awaits.

798
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,810
Tale as old as time

799
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,110
True as it can be

800
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,110
Barely even friends

801
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,740
Then somebody bends

802
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,240
Unexpectedly

803
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,870
Just a little change

804
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,460
Small to say the least

805
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,050
Both a little scared

806
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,670
Neither one prepared

807
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,050
Beauty and the beast

808
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,060
Ever just the same

809
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,480
Ever a surprise

810
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:52,400
Ever as before
Ever just as sure

811
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,070
As the sun will rise

812
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,540
Tale as old as time

813
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,460
Tune as old as song

814
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,550
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change

815
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,260
Learning you were wrong

816
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,640
Certain as the sun

817
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,270
Rising in the east

818
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:30,780
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

819
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,860
Beauty and the beast

820
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,780
Shh.

821
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,080
Tale as old as time

822
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,250
Song as old as rhyme

823
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:50,500
Beauty and the beast

824
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,260
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

825
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,760
It's past your bedtime.

826
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,180
Good night, love.

827
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,700
Belle?

828
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,630
Are you happy here with me?

829
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,710
Yes.

830
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,510
What is it?

831
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,260
If only I could see my father again
just for a moment.

832
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:46,230
I miss him so much.

833
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,610
There is a way.

834
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,740
This mirror
will show you anything...

835
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,660
anything you wish to see.

836
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,910
I would like to see my father, please.

837
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,590
Papa! Oh, no!

838
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,970
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

839
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:29,020
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?

840
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,560
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

841
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,820
You mean, I'm free?

842
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,780
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

843
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,280
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

844
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,910
Take it with you
so you'll always have a way...

845
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,290
to look back and remember me.

846
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,920
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

847
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,180
Well, Your Highness, I must say...

848
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,480
everything is going
just swimmingly.

849
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,480
I knew you had it in you.

850
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,610
I let her go.

851
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,400
Yes, yes, splen...

852
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,700
You what?
How could you do that?

853
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:28,240
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?

854
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,910
Because I love her.

855
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,620
He did what?

856
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:37,790
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?

857
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,880
But he was so close.

858
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,470
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

859
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,220
That's it then.
That should break the spell!

860
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,810
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

861
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:54,600
Now it's too late.

862
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:06,030
Papa? Papa?

863
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,170
They're back.

864
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,760
- Belle!
- Shh.

865
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,810
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

866
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,230
I thought I would never see you again.

867
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,770
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...

868
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,650
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.

869
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:43,190
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?

870
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,410
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

871
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,410
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.

872
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,380
Why, hello there, little fella.

873
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,800
Y... Didn't think I would see you again.

874
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,510
Belle, why would you go away?

875
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,760
Don't you like us any more?

876
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,430
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...

877
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:17,020
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.

878
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,810
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.

879
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,400
We'll take good care of him.

880
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:27,030
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!

881
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,030
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!

882
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,160
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?

883
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,910
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

884
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,630
Just how big was the beast?

885
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,210
He was... I mean,
he was... he was, uh, enormous!

886
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,680
I would... I would say at least eight,
uh, no, more like ten feet!

887
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,600
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that!

888
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,100
It's true, I tell you!

889
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,350
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!

890
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,810
No! You can't do this!

891
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,030
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.

892
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,820
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

893
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:13,910
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

894
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:16,790
- If what?
- If you marry me.

895
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,960
- What?
- One little word, Belle.

896
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,040
- That's all it takes.
- Never!

897
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:26,250
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!

898
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,920
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it!

899
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,260
Show me the beast.

900
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:39,060
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he would never hurt anyone.

901
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,230
Please, I-I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

902
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,480
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...

903
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:49,570
I would think you had feelings
for this monster.

904
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:52,200
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!

905
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,330
She's as crazy as the old man!

906
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,740
The beast will make off
with your children.

907
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,750
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!

908
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,290
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

909
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,130
I say we kill the beast!

910
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,420
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night

911
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,050
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite

912
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:16,720
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free

913
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,470
So it's time
to take some action, boys

914
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,730
It's time to follow me

915
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,280
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows

916
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,610
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

917
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,030
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

918
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,450
And there's something
truly terrible inside

919
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,330
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

920
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:46,630
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

921
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,250
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home

922
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,550
Till he's dead
Good and dead

923
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,840
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.

924
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,430
If you're not with us,
you're against us.

925
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:01,430
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!

926
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,140
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature!

927
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,770
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!

928
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,860
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!

929
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,900
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse

930
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,900
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

931
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,870
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

932
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,950
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle

933
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,000
Some thing's lurking
that you don't see every day

934
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,880
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain

935
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,790
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

936
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,210
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow

937
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,800
Praise the Lord and here we go

938
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,010
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

939
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,220
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.

940
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,480
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?

941
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,150
Now, now.
We'll think of something.

942
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:58,780
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us

943
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:02,410
And this monster
is mysterious at least

944
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,540
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives

945
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,710
We'll save our village
and our lives

946
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,790
We'll kill the beast

947
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,050
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

948
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,840
Maybe it would have been better
if she would never come at all.

949
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,050
- Could it be?
- Is it she?

950
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,550
Sacrebleu! Invaders!

951
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,180
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!

952
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,310
Warn the master. If it's a fight
they want, we'll be ready for them.

953
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:30,310
Who's with me?

954
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,400
Take whatever booty
you can find.

955
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,480
But remember,
the beast is mine!

956
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,450
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle

957
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,740
Unafraid although the danger
just increased

958
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:44,910
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong

959
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,040
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

960
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,960
Let's kill the beast

961
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,380
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.

962
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,960
But, sir,
the castle is under attack!

963
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,840
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

964
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,550
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!

965
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,010
Wait! I know!

966
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,350
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

967
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,190
What shall we do, Master?

968
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,980
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.

969
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:19,320
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

970
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,360
Kill the beast

971
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,920
Now!

972
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,230
Yes!

973
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,860
Here we go!

974
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,870
What the devil?

975
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,500
Belle, look out!

976
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:18,630
You guys gotta try this thing.

977
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,090
Up here, you scurvy scum.

978
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,060
Now!

979
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,670
And stay out!

980
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,740
Get up!

981
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,580
Get up!

982
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,870
What's the matter, beast?

983
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,920
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

984
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,970
No!

985
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,890
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!

986
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,440
Let's go, Philippe.

987
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,970
Come on out and fight!

988
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,180
Were you in love with her,
beast?

989
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,890
Did you honestly think
she would want you...

990
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,520
when she had someone like me?

991
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,870
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!

992
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,540
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.

993
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:47,460
I'll do anything. Anything!

994
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,520
Get out!

995
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,900
- Beast!
- Belle.

996
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,160
Belle?

997
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,170
You came back.

998
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:08,000
You... You came back.

999
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,250
Of course I came back.

1000
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,340
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.

1001
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,430
If only I would gotten here sooner.

1002
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:20,930
Maybe it's better...
it's better this way.

1003
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,390
Don't talk like that.

1004
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,890
You'll be all right.

1005
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,770
We're together now. Every thing's
going to be fine, you'll see.

1006
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,070
At least...

1007
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:38,570
I got to see you one last time.

1008
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:52,250
No! No!

1009
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,800
Please! Please!

1010
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,220
Please don't leave me.

1011
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,970
I love you.

1012
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,610
Belle, it's me!

1013
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,960
It is you!

1014
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,790
Lumiere!

1015
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,500
Cogsworth!

1016
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,210
Mrs Potts!

1017
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,340
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!

1018
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,140
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!

1019
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,150
Ah, I'amour.

1020
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,620
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1021
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,540
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.

1022
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:19,170
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh,
but I believe I told you.

1023
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,250
No, you didn't. I told you!

1024
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,960
You most certainly did not,
you pompous, paraffin-headed peabrain!

1025
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:28,430
En garde,
you-you overgrown pocket watch!

1026
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:30,720
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.

1027
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,980
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1028
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,600
Of course, my dear.

1029
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,900
Of course.

1030
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,610
Do I still have to sleep
in the cupboard?

1031
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,910
Certain as the sun

1032
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,660
Rising in the east

1033
01:19:55,750 --> 01:20:00,960
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

1034
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,670
Beauty and the beast

1035
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,930
Tale as old as time

1036
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:13,470
Song as old as rhyme

1037
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:18,810
Beauty and the beast

1038
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,210
Tale as old as time

1039
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:54,350
True as it can be

1040
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,480
Barely even friends

1041
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,690
Then somebody bends

1042
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:07,270
Unexpectedly

1043
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,530
Just a little change

1044
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,160
Small to say the least

1045
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,330
Both a little scared

1046
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,420
Neither one prepared

1047
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,170
Beauty and the beast

1048
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,550
Ever just the same

1049
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:42,230
Ever a surprise

1050
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:49,270
Ever as before
and ever just as sure

1051
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,780
As the sun will rise

1052
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,140
Ever just the same

1053
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:33,030
Ever a surprise

1054
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:36,200
Ever as before

1055
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,240
Ever just as sure

1056
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:43,120
As the sun will rise

1057
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,800
Tale as old as time

1058
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:59,180
Tune as old as song

1059
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:04,470
Bittersweet and strange

1060
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,560
Finding you can change

1061
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,980
Learning you were wrong

1062
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,900
Certain as the sun

1063
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,030
Certain as the sun

1064
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,160
Rising in the east

1065
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,160
Tale as old as time

1066
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,370
Song as old as rhyme

1067
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:34,000
Beauty and the beast

1068
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,680
Tale as old as time

1069
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,140
Song as old as rhyme

1070
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:49,440
Beauty and the beast

1071
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:22,470
Beauty and the beast
