2
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,652
A legend is sung

3
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,947
Of when England was young

4
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,119
And knights were brave and bold

5
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,831
The good king had died

6
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,709
And no one could decide

7
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:13,423
Who was rightful heir to the throne

8
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:21,098
It seemed that the land
would be torn by war

9
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,395
Or saved by a miracle alone

10
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,862
And that miracle appeared

11
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:40,951
In London town

12
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,165
The sword

13
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:52,379
In the stone

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,677
And below the hilt, in letters of gold,

15
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,346
were written these words,

16
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,684
"Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil

17
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,438
"is rightwise king born of England."

18
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,525
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,

19
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,528
none could move the sword, nor stir it.

20
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,740
So, the miracle had not worked.

21
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,327
And England was still without a king.

22
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,039
And in time,
the marvelous sword was forgotten.

23
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,589
This was a dark age,

24
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,634
without law and without order.

25
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,096
Men lived in fear of one another,

26
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,141
for the strong preyed upon the weak.

27
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,300
A dark age, indeed!

28
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,428
Age of inconvenience.

29
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,098
No plumbing.

30
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,393
No electricity.

31
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,436
No nothing.

32
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,649
Hang it all!

33
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,526
Hang it all.

34
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,240
Now what? Now what?

35
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,284
Leave off, leave off!

36
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,538
You... You fiendish chain, you!

37
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,625
Everything complicated.

38
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,295
One big medieval mess.

39
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,974
Now, let me see...

40
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,185
He should be here in...
I'd say half an hour.

41
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,521
Who? Who?

42
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,815
I'd like to know who.

43
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,818
I told you, Archimedes. I am not sure.

44
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,529
All I know is that someone
will be coming.

45
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,989
Someone very important.

46
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,991
Pin feathers.

47
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,828
Fate will direct him to me
so that I in turn may guide him

48
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,372
to his rightful place in the world.

49
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,334
And you say he will arrive
in half an hour?

50
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,671
Well, we'll just see.

51
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,008
And you will, Archimedes, you will.

52
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,806
He'll be a boy.

53
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,726
A small boy.

54
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,480
Eleven, 12 years old,

55
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,691
and a scrawny little fellow.

56
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,529
Oh, no, no, no. That can't be the one.

57
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,532
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close on to 20.

58
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,622
There he is.
The scrawny little fellow, about 12.

59
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,208
He's a regular little grasshopper.

60
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,127
Look at him go.

61
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,882
And where, where would you guess
he is at this very moment?

62
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,887
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I know where he is!

63
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,058
Less than a mile from here,

64
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,102
just beyond the forest.

65
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,562
And right on schedule.

66
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,606
If all goes well.

67
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,068
Quiet, Wart.

68
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,986
I'm trying to be.

69
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,990
And nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.

70
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,993
- I'm not even moving.
- Shut up.

71
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,792
Here we go. What a set-up.

72
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,505
Right smack through the old gizzard.

73
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,094
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

74
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,097
Why, you clumsy little fool!

75
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,725
Kay, please, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

76
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,227
Please.

77
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,729
If I ever...

78
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,067
If I ever get my hands on you
I'll wring your scrawny little neck,

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,527
so help me, I will.

80
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,280
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

81
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,370
Don't tell me you're going in there.

82
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,249
- Why, it's swarming with wolves.
- I'm not afraid.

83
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,337
Well, go ahead. It's your skin, not mine.

84
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,131
Go on, go on.

85
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,621
There it is. There it is!

86
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,192
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

87
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,240
Well.

88
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,868
So, you did drop in for tea, after all.

89
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,289
You are a bit late, you know.

90
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,583
I am?

91
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,210
Yes.

92
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,712
Now, my name is Merlin.

93
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,341
Come, come. Who are you, my lad?

94
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,469
My name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

95
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,224
What a perfect stuffed owl.

96
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,602
Stuffed? I beg your pardon!

97
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,230
He's alive, and he talks!

98
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,316
And certainly a great deal better
than you do.

99
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,903
Come, Archimedes.

100
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,407
Come, come, now.
I want you to meet the Wart.

101
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,577
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

102
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,745
Boy? Boy.

103
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,914
I see no boy.

104
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,752
- I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right.

105
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,256
- He's much too sensitive.
- Sensitive?

106
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,883
Who? What, what?

107
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,012
- How did you know that I was...
- That you'd be dropping in?

108
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,016
Well, I happen to be a wizard.

109
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,144
A soothsayer, a prognosticator.

110
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,188
I have the power to see into the future.

111
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,276
Centuries into the future.

112
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,905
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.

113
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,076
They're only plans and small models,
of course.

114
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,123
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

115
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,756
There she goes.

116
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,466
Pretty good, eh?

117
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,974
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.

118
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,353
You mean you can see everything
before it happens?

119
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,313
Yes, everything.

120
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,982
Everything, Merlin?

121
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,819
No, no, not everything.

122
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,199
I... I admit I didn't know whom
to expect for tea.

123
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,534
But as you can see,

124
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,330
I figured the exact place.

125
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,916
You're very clever, sir.

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,877
Yes. Well, never mind the "sir".

127
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,463
Just plain Merlin will do.

128
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,218
- Now, would you care for sugar?
- Yes, I would.

129
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,928
- Please.
- All right.

130
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,680
Sugar? Sugar!

131
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,479
No. Manners, manners.
Guests first. You know that!

132
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,859
All right. Just say when, lad.

133
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,319
When.

134
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,448
- Have you had any schooling?
- Yes.

135
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,368
I'm training to be a squire.

136
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,454
I'm learning the rules of combat
and swordsmanship

137
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,873
and jousting and horsemanship.

138
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,210
Yes, yes. Very good. That...

139
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,715
No, no, no! I... I mean a real education.

140
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,927
Mathematics, history,
biology, natural science,

141
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,596
English, Latin, French.

142
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,142
No. When, when! Blast it all. When!

143
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,646
Impudent piece of crockery.

144
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,903
Boy, now, you can't...

145
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,245
You can't grow up
without a decent education, you know.

146
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,331
I suppose not, sir... Merlin.

147
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,002
So, I am going to be your tutor.

148
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,920
But I've got to get back to the castle.

149
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,549
- They'll want me in the kitchen.
- Well, then, very well.

150
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,343
We'll pack and be on our way.

151
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,055
You... You watch now. You'll like this.

152
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,729
Higitus figitus zumbakazing.

153
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,275
I want your attention, everything.

154
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,030
We're packing to leave.
Come on, let's go.

155
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,200
No, no, not you.
Books are always first, you know.

156
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,206
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack

157
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,249
Abra abra dabra nack

158
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,253
Shrink in size, very small
We've got to save enough room for all

159
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,341
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

160
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,269
Alakafez, balakazez
Malakamez meripides

161
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,605
Hockety, pockety, wockety...

162
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,192
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop.

163
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,902
Sugar bowl, you're getting rough.

164
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,196
That poor old tea set
is cracked enough.

165
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,493
All right. Let's start again. Let's start...

166
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,787
Where was I, boy?

167
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,916
- Hockety, pockety?
- Yes. Yes, that's right.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,086
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack
Odds and ends and bric a brac

169
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,548
I'll be with you in a minute, son.
Packing's almost done.

170
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,222
You... You bungling blockhead!

171
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,267
Hey, easy there. No, go ahead.

172
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,603
Dun goo-dily doo-dily doo-dily dun.
This is the best part.

173
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,982
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

174
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,235
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitoni...

175
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,573
What a way to pack.

176
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,451
Well... Now, just a minute, boy.

177
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,831
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know.

178
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,002
- But I think it's wonderful.
- Yes, it is, rather.

179
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:46,926
Now, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

180
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,511
Because it won't!

181
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,763
But sir, I don't have any problems.

182
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,893
Everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

183
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,731
Blast it all.
There, now you see what I did?

184
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,575
That's the trouble with the world today.

185
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,536
Everybody butting their heads
against a brick wall.

186
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,331
All muscle and no mentality.

187
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain?

188
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,628
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't?

189
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,048
- Well, how do you move about?
- I suppose I do have a little.

190
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,383
There, you see? Well, that's enough.

191
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,970
Now, develop your brain. Knowledge,
wisdom, there's the real power.

192
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,057
Higher learning, that's the thing.

193
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,104
First thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.

194
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,439
Eight hours a day.

195
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,401
We'll have six hours for school room
and two for study period.

196
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,570
But I al...

197
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,573
But I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

198
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,992
Page duties?

199
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,084
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

200
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,545
Well, yes, sir. I suppose so.

201
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,591
How do you expect to amount
to anything without an education?

202
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,636
Even in these bungling,
backward medieval times

203
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,348
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

204
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,309
Yes, sir.

205
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,727
Yes, of course.

206
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,357
You must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.

207
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,275
And you've got...

208
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,698
Now, by the by,
what direction is this castle of yours?

209
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,908
I think it's north. The other way.

210
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,332
All right. We'd better get a move on.
Come on, lad. Pick up the pace.

211
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,031
The devil take it.

212
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,825
The devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense

213
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,203
than to go barging off
in that infernal forest alone.

214
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,415
You had no business letting him go.

215
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,542
Look, Dad,

216
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,422
- I'm not the Wart's keeper.
- Well, blast it all, I am!

217
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,676
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

218
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,429
Being his foster father, I'm responsible.

219
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,730
Tiger, Talbert, off with you.

220
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,109
Look here. What's the big idea
of gallivanting off in the woods

221
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,988
- and worrying everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,406
Well, sorry's not enough.

223
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,368
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.

224
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,164
- Report to the cook.
- But I'd like you to meet...

225
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,000
Go on, hop it, boy. Hop, hop, hop it.

226
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,088
You've got to keep a schedule
to run a place like this.

227
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,092
You need strict rules,
especially for small boys.

228
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,969
And I most certainly agree.

229
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,263
Who are you, and...

230
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,767
- I mean, you?
- My name is Merlin.

231
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:27,146
And this is Archimedes,
the highly-educated owl.

232
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,776
Educated owl?

233
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,112
Say, that's a good one.

234
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,115
Say, say, I know.

235
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,826
You've got him under a spell, Marvin.

236
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,288
- You're a magician.
- The name is Merlin.

237
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,128
And I happen to be
the world's most powerful wizard.

238
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,464
Come off it, man.

239
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,094
- Gadzooks.
- All right. I shall demonstrate.

240
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,139
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo,

241
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,642
wind and snow swirl and blow.

242
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,646
What the devil are you up to?

243
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,776
That is what I call a "wizard blizzard."

244
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,071
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?

245
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,865
An indoor blizzard.

246
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,159
And in the month of July.

247
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,451
So what?

248
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,372
All right, Marvin, turn her off.

249
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm convinced.

250
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,460
Alakazam.

251
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,509
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

252
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,511
Oh, no, no, no, no.

253
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,680
Never touch the stuff.

254
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,559
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

255
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,106
In fact, that is why I am here.

256
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,318
I have come to educate the Wart.

257
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,361
Oh, no, you don't.

258
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,946
I'm running this place.

259
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,282
If you think you're gonna
fiddle with my schedule,

260
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,118
pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.

261
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,208
Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone.

262
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,960
Good riddance.

263
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,923
I'm gone, but then I'm not gone.

264
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,970
So, if I do leave you can never be sure
that I am gone.

265
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,306
- Can you?
- Well...

266
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,686
Well, I must say,
you've got me there, Marvin.

267
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,525
Where are you?
And you're welcome to stay, if you like.

268
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,570
Thank you. You're very kind.

269
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,448
Very generous, I must say.

270
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,494
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.

271
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,537
Hard times, you know, Marvin.

272
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,917
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.

273
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,087
It's drafty in the winter,
but in this hot weather

274
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,172
it's the best room in the house.

275
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,717
Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed.

276
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,054
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.

277
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,848
Marvin? Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

278
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,617
Best room in the house!

279
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,372
Guest room. Unwelcome guest room!

280
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,751
If he thinks that he can get rid of me,
I've got news for that old walrus.

281
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,878
I'm sticking it out!

282
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,132
And I say we go back to the woods.

283
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,759
No, not on your life.

284
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,138
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

285
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,557
You may be right.

286
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,602
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

287
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,361
Something tells me
that you're all wet, Archimedes.

288
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,415
- Who goes there?
- Pellinore.

289
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,043
It's Pellinore, dash it all.

290
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,380
I've got big news from London.
Big news.

291
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,009
Come on, man. Drop the bridge.

292
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,938
Well... Big news, eh?

293
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,649
Well, can't wait for the London Times.

294
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,029
First edition won't be out for at least,
12 hundred years.

295
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,325
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and...

296
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,202
Not interested.

297
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,081
Come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.

298
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,042
No. No, no, no.

299
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,380
Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human.

300
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,217
- You wouldn't dare.
- I will. So help me, I will.

301
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,928
All right. All right. All right!

302
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,513
All right.

303
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,723
Works every time.

304
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,600
Just like magic.

305
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,905
Pellinore!

306
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,411
Pellinore. Greetings, old boy.

307
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,080
What's all the noise about London?

308
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,583
Big news, really big news.

309
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,420
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

310
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,298
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

311
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,759
That's not news, dash it all.

312
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,470
- They always do.
- But Ector, Ector,

313
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,098
here's where
all the excitement comes in.

314
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,770
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

315
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,901
You mean...
You mean he'll be king of all England?

316
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,947
King of all England.

317
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,534
Kay, lad, did you hear that?

318
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,953
Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

319
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,748
Yes, and you could win it, boy,
if you'd knuckle down to your training.

320
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,794
We'll have you knighted by Christmas,
off to London. What do you say?

321
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,006
Sure. Why not? Why not?

322
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,967
Wart, lad,
how'd you like to go to London?

323
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,635
Sir Ector, you mean it?

324
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,346
If you stick to your duties
you can be Kay's squire.

325
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,515
I will, sir, I will.

326
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,647
I don't want the Wart for my squire.

327
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,359
Here's to London, and here's to Kay.

328
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,447
And here's to the banner
of the castle of the Forest Sauvage!

329
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,324
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

330
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,302
Charge!

331
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,514
Wait, boy. Lean into it.

332
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,184
Steady, boy, steady.
Steady with the lance.

333
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,437
Do it, white knight! Hit him clean.

334
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,732
No. No, no!

335
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,987
Heads up!

336
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,410
Archimedes?

337
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,788
Archimedes, where are we?

338
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,040
In a tumbled-down old tower

339
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,378
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

340
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,214
Castle? Castle?

341
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,508
Don't you even remember the boy?

342
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,510
The boy?

343
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,304
Can't you remember one blasted thing?

344
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,306
Now, just a moment. I...

345
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,600
Tight grip on the lance.

346
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,812
Loose in the saddle, knees in tight,

347
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,856
weight forward and stay on target.

348
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,570
You keep losing your grip.

349
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,739
It's not a mere matter of muscle, son.

350
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,909
Jousting is a fine skill.

351
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,121
It... It's a highly developed science.

352
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,374
Science, indeed.

353
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,253
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

354
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,756
And the Wart's just as hot for it
as the rest of them.

355
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,176
He certainly is.
That boy's got real spark.

356
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,469
Lots of spirit.

357
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,889
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

358
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:45,477
That's really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction.

359
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,605
Fat chance of that.

360
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,066
I plan to cheat, of course.

361
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,193
Use magic.

362
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,614
Every last trick in the trade if I have to.

363
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,045
I'd give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger,

364
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,090
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

365
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,595
- Well, won't you?
- Oh, no.

366
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,557
You see, I'm an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth.

367
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,518
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

368
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,854
That's a big job too, you know.

369
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,856
Oh, indeed. Yes, yes.

370
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,276
I would say almost impossible.

371
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,697
Yes. Well, now then,
when I said I could swim like a fish,

372
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,200
I really meant as a fish.

373
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,995
You mean you can turn yourself
into a fish?

374
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,873
After all, I happen to be a wizard.

375
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,708
Could you turn me into a fish?

376
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,088
Do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?

377
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,881
That's easy.

378
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,592
I've done that lots of times.

379
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,221
Well, good. Then I think that my magic
can do the rest.

380
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,727
Archimedes, what is that fish formula?

381
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,358
Who? Who? What?

382
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,902
You know, that Latin business.

383
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,737
Fish? Latin?

384
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:25,077
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus.

385
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:30,040
And now, if you don't mind,
I say good day to the both of you.

386
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,667
If you please.

387
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,463
When he stays out all night
he's always grumpy the next morning.

388
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,883
- He must stay out every night.
- Yes, yes.

389
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,638
Oh, yes. I say, that's very good, boy.

390
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,516
Who? What, what?

391
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,310
All right, boy. All set. Here we go.

392
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,063
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom.

393
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,399
Aquadigitarium.

394
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,573
Merlin, am I a fish? Am I a fish?

395
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,117
Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish.

396
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,828
If you don't stop
flipping and flopping around

397
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,247
and get in the water you won't last long.

398
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,088
Now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll be with you in a minute.

399
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,776
So, you thought you could take right off
like a shot, did you?

400
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,199
Well, I am a fish, aren't I?

401
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,577
You merely look like a fish.

402
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,038
That doesn't mean
you can swim like one.

403
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,290
You don't have the instinct.

404
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:57,795
So, you'll have to use your brain
for a change.

405
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,297
You are living between two planes now,

406
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:04,009
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

407
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,809
Now, there are lots of ups and downs,
like a helicopter.

408
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,561
- Helicopter?
- Yes.

409
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,523
It... It... No, never mind.

410
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,735
Every flick of a fin creates movement.

411
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,322
So, first we'll start with the caudal fin.

412
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,118
No, no, boy. Your tail, tail.

413
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,545
Now, that gives you the forward thrust.
Now, let's get a rhythm.

414
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,215
Right, left, right, left

415
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,760
One, two, left and right

416
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,720
By day and night

417
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,307
That's what makes the world go round

418
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,061
In and out
Thin and stout

419
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,690
That's what makes the world go round

420
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,193
For every up there is a down

421
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,445
- For every square
- There is a round?

422
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,697
Yes.

423
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,450
- For every high
- There is a low?

424
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,869
And for every to

425
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,328
- There is a...
- Fro.

426
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,788
- Fro?
- Yes, fro.

427
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,708
To and fro, stop and go

428
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,670
That's what makes the world go round

429
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,673
In and out
Thin and stout

430
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,383
Merlin? Merlin?

431
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,635
I swallowed a bug.

432
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,764
What's wrong with that?
After all, boy, you are a fish.

433
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,725
Instincts, you know.

434
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,894
But you said I had no instinct.

435
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,562
Yes.

436
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,565
I did. That's neither here nor there.

437
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,401
The main thing is, you must...

438
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,446
Set your sights upon the heights

439
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,073
Don't be a mediocrity

440
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,284
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.

441
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,078
Don't just wait and trust to fate

442
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,415
And say that's how it's meant to be

443
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,501
It's up to you how far you go

444
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,713
If you don't try you'll never know

445
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,758
And so, my lad, as I've explained

446
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,011
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

447
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:29,279
Let's... Let's swim through
that tall grass again. It tickles.

448
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,708
I beg your pardon.

449
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,168
Me, too.

450
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,921
For every to there is a fro

451
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,674
For every stop there is a go

452
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,344
And that's what makes
the world go round

453
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,721
Let go, let go, let go.

454
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,309
You big bug-eyed bully, you.

455
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,186
Who, me?

456
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,106
Here, here, here, here, here now, boy.

457
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,692
No sense going around
insulting bullfrogs.

458
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,029
A fish has plenty of other problems
without that.

459
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,491
The water world has its forests
and its jungles, too.

460
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,619
So, it has its tigers and its wolves.

461
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,996
But that...

462
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,999
That's what makes the world go round

463
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,501
You see, my boy
it's nature's way

464
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,462
Upon the weak
the strong ones prey

465
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,340
In human life, it's also true

466
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,218
The strong will try to conquer you

467
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,846
That is what you must expect

468
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,849
Unless you use your intellect

469
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,351
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong

470
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,438
- Merlin, help, help!
- That's what makes the worl...

471
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,523
Jehoshaphat!

472
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,577
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
- No, no, you're on your own, lad.

473
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,789
- Now's your chance to prove my point.
- What point?

474
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,710
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Now, don't panic!

475
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,005
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.

476
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,053
Smart move, lad.
That's using the old intellect.

477
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,391
Bravo, boy. Great strategy.

478
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,104
- Is the lesson about over?
- Did you get the point?

479
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,481
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.

480
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,316
OK, lad, I'll fix the big brute.

481
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,110
Higgly piggly... No, no.

482
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,445
Hocus pocus... No! What the blazes...

483
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,115
- Hey didda dihicka...
- Merlin!

484
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,369
Now what?

485
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,914
Is it that, that boy?

486
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,000
- What in blazes...
- Help, help!

487
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:42,597
Help!

488
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,271
Archimedes!

489
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,856
Help!

490
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,467
What... What in...

491
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,512
What in thunder is a monster like that
doing in the moat?

492
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,598
By George, I...

493
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,184
I'll turn him into a minnow.

494
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,520
- Merlin.
- There you are, boy.

495
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,398
Snick, snack, snorrel.

496
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,860
How in the world
did you ever get out of that mess?

497
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,529
That big fish almost swallowed me,

498
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,282
and Archimedes, he, he saved me.

499
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,034
Well, by Jove.

500
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,953
Now, what do you know about that?

501
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,707
I... I did nothing of the sort!

502
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,876
I intended to eat him.

503
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,212
Young perch is my favorite dish.

504
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,588
You know that.

505
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,260
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, I...

506
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,638
Wart! Wart!

507
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,224
I've got to go. Thank you, Merlin.

508
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,018
It was so much fun. And Archimedes, I...

509
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,729
- Pin feathers, boy.
- Wart!

510
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,899
- Where are you, Wart?
- Coming! I'm coming.

511
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,069
Now, Archimedes,

512
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:23,490
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish?

513
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,409
And after such a big breakfast.

514
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:30,205
Pin feathers and gully fluff.

515
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,833
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.

516
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,421
Then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth.

517
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,841
- Turn him off, Dad.
- He was a monster.

518
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,510
The biggest fish I ever saw.

519
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,764
And, boy, that's the biggest fish story
I ever heard.

520
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,518
- But it's true, sir.
- That's three demerits for being late

521
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,187
and three more for the fish story.

522
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,897
Now, hop it to the kitchen!

523
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,651
I told you the Wart was loony.

524
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:04,614
He's either out of his head or
there's something fishy going on here.

525
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,370
For every high there is a low

526
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,082
For every to there is a fro

527
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,544
To and fro
Stop and go

528
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,922
That's what makes the world go round

529
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,969
- It's you, Merlin, sir.
- Yes, my lad.

530
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:30,724
Now, have you ever considered
being a squirrel?

531
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,019
- No, I don't suppose.
- Well, now,

532
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,398
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems.

533
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,818
How he has survived
throughout the ages

534
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,779
is one of nature's big mysteries.

535
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,615
His life is hazardous.

536
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,492
Downright dangerous.

537
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,954
Would you like to try it?

538
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,456
No, I'd better not.

539
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,502
Too dangerous for you, eh?

540
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,755
No, it's not that.

541
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,175
It's just that I've got six demerits.
All this work to do.

542
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,510
What a mess.

543
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,014
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.

544
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,600
Start an assembly line system.

545
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,936
All right, now.

546
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,147
A one and a two and a three and a four.

547
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,992
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Tittendy, bittendy, buttondy, dum

548
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,998
But I'm supposed to do it.

549
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,958
No one will know the difference, son

550
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,086
Who cares
as long as the work gets done?

551
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,970
Rubbety, scrubbety, sweepity, flew

552
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,102
Come on, son, let's go, let's go.

553
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,081
Wart!

554
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,126
Wart, take it easy. Take it easy, boy.

555
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,170
Wart! Oh, no, boy. No, no!

556
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,340
- Wart!
- Wha... Wait. Whoa!

557
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,803
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.

558
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,597
Well, I made it, didn't I?

559
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,683
Yes, yes, you made it, you made it.

560
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,145
But you can't always trust to luck, boy.

561
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:45,108
Now, first you start with the short jumps.

562
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,486
Gauge the distance carefully and...

563
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,659
There, you see?
Even then you can miss.

564
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,913
So, don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.

565
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,792
- What's gravity?
- Gravity's what causes you to fall.

566
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,671
- Like a stumble or a trip?
- Yes, like a stumble or a...

567
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,799
No, no, no.
It's the force that pulls you downward.

568
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:14,596
The phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies,

569
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:19,267
if free to move,
will be accelerated toward each other.

570
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,993
Merlin, how will we get by?

571
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,415
Well, I suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack.

572
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,297
Go on, go on. You've got lots of room.

573
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,471
Well, I guess she can't be sidetracked.

574
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,557
That's a girl squirrel
and a redhead, at that.

575
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,989
- She sure acts funny.
- She likes you.

576
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,407
Why?

577
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,286
Yes, well. Well, that's nature again.

578
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,122
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.

579
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,667
Here now,
you'd better leave me out of it.

580
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,879
Yeah. Me, too.

581
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,924
Merlin.

582
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,593
- Merlin!
- You're on your own, lad.

583
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,346
I'm afraid magic
can't solve this problem.

584
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,350
Look, I'm not a boy... I mean...

585
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,103
I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy.

586
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,855
A human boy, not a real sq...

587
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,485
Leave me alone.

588
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,824
Merlin, what will I do?
She won't leave me...

589
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,915
Well, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
When a girl squirrel chooses a mate,

590
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,333
it's for life.

591
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,502
But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.

592
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,047
She doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact,

593
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,925
that you're a him and she's a her.

594
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,262
It's a natural phenomenon.

595
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,763
Phenomenon?

596
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,724
Well, it's the...

597
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,770
It's a state of being, a frame of mind

598
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,648
It's a most befuddling thing

599
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,568
And to every being
Of every kind

600
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,862
It is discomboomerating

601
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,657
You're wasting time resisting

602
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,660
You'll find the more you do

603
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,622
The more she'll keep insisting

604
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,625
Her "him" has got to be you

605
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,168
Now, leave me alone.

606
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,628
I mean it!

607
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,255
It's a rough game, anyone knows

608
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,965
Go away!

609
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,303
There are no rules
Anything goes

610
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:06,643
There's no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration

611
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:10,980
It's a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing

612
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,737
Who? Who? What the...

613
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,990
Now, go on, shoo.
Get a tree of your own.

614
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,617
Skedaddle.

615
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,731
You squirrelly squirrels!

616
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,568
She's gaining on you, Wart.

617
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:04,659
There's no sensible explanation
for this discomboomeration

618
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,912
It's a most hodgepodge-ical
most illogical

619
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,581
Most confuse-ling, most bamboozling

620
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,877
Most bemuddling
Most befuddling

621
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,713
Thing

622
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,302
Really, now, Miss...

623
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,846
Madam, I...

624
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,473
You, you've made a mistake.

625
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,226
Now, now, now, please.

626
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,145
Madam. Madam!

627
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,358
Look here.

628
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,154
I am not a boy.
I mean, I am not a squirrel.

629
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,822
I'm a boy.

630
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,532
No, that's not what I meant.

631
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,284
No!

632
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,412
No, I'm a stupid old...

633
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,913
No!

634
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,041
I'm an old man.

635
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,127
An old hu... man.

636
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,421
Understand?

637
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,303
Hang it all. Now, go away.

638
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,231
Impossible. Impossible.

639
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,111
Confound it.

640
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,363
Confound it all!

641
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,411
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.

642
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,623
You've got trouble? Look at my...
Look back there!

643
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,043
One side, lad.

644
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,132
Help, Merlin, help!

645
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,693
By George!

646
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,032
I've had enough of this nonsense.

647
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,702
Alakazam.

648
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:01,669
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible,
grouchy old man.

649
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,553
Merlin.

650
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,391
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.

651
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,643
Snick, snack, snorrel.

652
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,900
There. Now you see? I'm not a squirrel.

653
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,401
I'm a boy.

654
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,031
I tried to tell you. I'm a boy.

655
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,991
A human boy.

656
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,871
If you could only understand.

657
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,302
You know, lad,
that love business is a powerful thing.

658
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,683
Greater than gravity?

659
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,436
Well, yes, boy, in its way.

660
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:05,232
I'd... Yes, I'd say it's
the greatest force on earth.

661
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,580
Ector! Ector!

662
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,999
Sir Ector, the kitchen!

663
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,376
Hold it, son.

664
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,754
- Madness all over the place.
- Kay!

665
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,923
Hold that, I say.

666
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,306
Now, what's all the commotion?

667
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,685
The kitchen, it's under an evil spell.

668
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,061
It's bewitched.

669
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,022
No! I bet it's that old goat, Marvin.

670
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,817
Come on, son.
I knew he'd give us trouble.

671
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,241
Gadzooks!

672
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,661
Black magic of the worst kind!

673
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,205
Come on, Kay, to the attack!

674
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,726
Heaven preserve us!

675
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,353
Kay!

676
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,668
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hop toads.

677
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,005
Alakazam!

678
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,054
So there you are, you old goat.

679
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:04,560
What's the idea of flinging
your evil spells all over the place?

680
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,520
Lend me a hand, boy.

681
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,445
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

682
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:19,784
You call washing dishes
and sweeping floors a work of evil?

683
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,995
I'll decide what's right and wrong
around here.

684
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,831
Besides, that's the Wart's job,
one of his duties.

685
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,167
Look here, boy.

686
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,587
If you want to make that trip to London,
you'd better toe the mark.

687
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,255
You old goat!

688
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,717
If I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll...

689
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,762
Madam, you won't.

690
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,680
Oh, dear.

691
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,641
He's gone.

692
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,810
Well, by Jove.

693
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,646
We ought to run the old geezer
right out of the castle.

694
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,649
Oh, no. No, no, Kay, no.

695
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,401
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us.

696
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,779
Turn us all into stone.

697
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,782
No, there's no telling
what the old devil might do.

698
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,534
He's not an old devil!

699
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,746
He... He's good
and his magic is good, too.

700
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,208
- If... If you just leave him alone.
- Now, look here, Wart.

701
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,711
- That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.

702
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:17,299
Just because you can't understand
something, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

703
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,884
Ten more demerits!

704
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,887
You make all the rules
and nobody else can say anything.

705
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,722
You've said a-plenty, boy.

706
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,809
All that popping off
just cooked your goose. Kay!

707
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,104
From now on,
young Hobbs is your squire.

708
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,480
Did you hear that, Wart?

709
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,484
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.

710
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,111
Yes, sir.

711
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,364
That will teach you to pop off,
you little pipsqueak.

712
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,713
I'm sorry, lad.

713
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,674
I'm sorry. I spoiled everything.

714
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,178
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.

715
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,346
It's not your fault.

716
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,348
I shouldn't have popped off.

717
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,517
Now I'm really done for.

718
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,312
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.

719
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,648
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.

720
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,358
I'd like to know how.

721
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,860
Use your head.

722
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,820
An education, lad.

723
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,784
- What good will that do?
- Get it first, then, who knows?

724
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,328
Are you willing to try?

725
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,873
Well, what have I got to lose?

726
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,459
That's the spirit. We'll start tomorrow.

727
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,794
We'll show 'em, won't we, boy?

728
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,630
We sure will.

729
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,884
Now, first of all, lad,

730
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,512
we've got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head.

731
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,390
Clear the way for new ideas.

732
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:53,646
Knowledge of man's fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead.

733
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,856
Now, that will be a great advantage.

734
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,816
Advantage, indeed!

735
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,946
If the boy says the world is round
they'll take him for a lunatic.

736
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,907
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

737
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,452
And it also goes around.

738
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:15,251
- You mean, it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no. It's round now.

739
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,128
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

740
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,964
And he will also find

741
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:25,177
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe.

742
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,347
- Universe?
- You're only confusing the boy.

743
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:32,393
He'll be so mixed up he'll...
He'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

744
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,687
Man has always learned from the past.

745
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,106
After all, you can't learn history
in reverse.

746
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,942
It's confusing enough,
for heaven's sakes.

747
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,736
All right. All right.

748
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,448
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.

749
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,367
You're the headmaster now.

750
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,953
So, from now on he's your pupil.

751
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,083
So, from now on, boy,

752
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,043
you do as I say.

753
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,045
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

754
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,300
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.

755
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,634
All of them?

756
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,971
That, my boy,
is a mountain of knowledge.

757
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,224
- But I can't read.
- What, what? What!

758
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,144
- I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.

759
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,646
- Well, what do you know?
- Well, I...

760
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,650
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's.

761
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,739
First the A and now the B.

762
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,492
Loop and around and there's the C.

763
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,620
Merlin, look. I can write!

764
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,332
Oh, yes, yes. That's very good, boy.

765
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,500
Hen scratch, that's all. Hen scratch.

766
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:42,087
Now, come on. D, E, F.

767
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,340
And now the G.

768
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,010
You see, it's as simple as...
No, no, no, no, boy!

769
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:52,389
Use your head, use your head, will you?
How do you expect to learn anything?

770
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,557
Archimedes.

771
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:59,188
Have you seen
that flying machine model?

772
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,359
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

773
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,070
What's that thing up there?

774
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,031
Yes, of course. Here we are.

775
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,867
Do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday?

776
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,829
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

777
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:21,710
I am about to prove otherwise,
Archimedes, if you care to watch.

778
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,588
Here she goes!

779
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,716
No, no, no!

780
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,554
Man will fly, all right.

781
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,848
Just like a rock.

782
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:42,731
It would have worked if...
If it weren't for this infernal beard.

783
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,828
I never...

784
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,789
Never in my whole...

785
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,423
Man will fly someday, I tell you.

786
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,467
I have been there. I have seen it.

787
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:15,097
I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying.

788
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,684
That I was a bird and that
I could go sailing all over the sky,

789
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,436
high above everything.

790
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,106
Avis alitus avita atheta.
Prestidigitonium.

791
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,275
It's my favorite dream.

792
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,903
But then, I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

793
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,532
I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird!

794
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,035
Hold it, boy. Not so fast, not so fast.

795
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,123
First, I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.

796
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,710
Now, these large feathers

797
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,130
are called the primaries, and...

798
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:52,926
And since when do you know
all about birds' wings?

799
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,889
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and I...

800
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,976
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

801
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,189
All right, Mr. Know-it-All!
He's your pupil.

802
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:11,820
Now, boy, flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

803
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,868
It is a delicate art, purely aesthetic,

804
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,661
poetry of motion.

805
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,164
And the best way to learn it is to do it.

806
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:26,168
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

807
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,213
Spread your wings way out. Way out!

808
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,631
That's it, that's it.

809
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,175
Now, fan your tail.

810
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:37,179
Tippety toe, tippety toe and off we go.

811
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,643
Now, tuck your feet under like me.

812
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,604
That's it. That's the idea.

813
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,190
Whoa. What?

814
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,610
And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.

815
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,624
Why, say, boy!

816
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,751
That's pretty good.

817
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,879
Well, boy, you're a natural.

818
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,383
Are you sure this is
the first time that you...

819
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,010
Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk!

820
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,556
Look out, boy, heads up!
Come on, Wart!

821
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,934
Archimedes, help!

822
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,985
Wart! Wart!

823
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,914
What?

824
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,049
Sounds like someone's sick.

825
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,968
How lovely.

826
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,970
I do hope it's serious.

827
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,347
Something dreadful.

828
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,391
Bat gizzards.

829
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,604
It's nothing but a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.

830
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,107
I'm not really a sparrow. I'm a boy.

831
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,942
A boy?

832
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,071
Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.

833
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,115
Merlin!

834
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,827
Merlin.
The world's most powerful bungler.

835
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:27,080
Why, boy, I've got more magic
in one little finger.

836
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,836
Now, don't tell me you've never heard
of the marvelous Madam Mim?

837
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,547
Well, no, I don't guess so.

838
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,049
Madam Mim!

839
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,842
Good heavens.

840
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,094
Why, boy, I'm the greatest.

841
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,388
I'm truly marvelous.

842
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:48,143
With only a touch
I have the power

843
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,728
Zim zabberim bim

844
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,272
To wither a flower

845
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,692
I find delight
in the gruesome and grim

846
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,445
- That's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.

847
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,157
But that's nothing, nothing for me.

848
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,204
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

849
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:10,874
You know what?
I can even change size.

850
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,293
I can be huge

851
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,545
Fill the whole house

852
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,883
I can be teeny
small as a mouse

853
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,595
Black sorcery is my dish of tea

854
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,641
It comes easy to me

855
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:32,020
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

856
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:38,276
Marvelous, boy.
Marvelous, I'm marvelous.

857
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,950
Say, lad, did you know
that I can make myself uglier yet?

858
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,994
That would be some trick.

859
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,747
- I mean...
- Want to bet?

860
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,127
You see? I win, I win!

861
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,713
Aren't I hideous, boy?

862
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,258
- Perfectly revolting?
- Well... Yes, ma'am.

863
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,386
But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.

864
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:10,267
I can be beautiful
Lovely and fair

865
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:14,604
Silvery voice
Long purple hair

866
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,567
La la la-la
La la la la-la

867
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:22,654
La la-la la la
La-la la-la la la

868
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,075
But it's only skin-deep
Zim zabberim zim

869
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,703
I'm an ugly old creep

870
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:35,083
The magnificent, marvelous
mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim

871
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,005
Now what do you think, boy?

872
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,631
Who's the greatest?

873
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,887
Well, Merlin's magic is always,

874
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,599
well, useful for something good.

875
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,643
And he must see
something good in you.

876
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,187
I suppose so.

877
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,564
Yes, and in my book that's bad.

878
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:03,111
So, my boy,
I'm afraid I'll have to destroy you.

879
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,030
De... Destroy me?

880
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,657
Yeah, I'll give you a sporting chance.

881
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,786
I'm mad about games, you know.

882
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,038
Well, come on. Get going, boy.

883
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,582
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.

884
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,178
I win, I win!

885
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,429
The game's over.

886
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,601
Why, you little devil, you!

887
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,229
I'll wring your scrawny little neck.

888
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,773
Mim. Mim!

889
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,192
What... What are you up to?

890
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,110
Oh, Merlin.

891
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:48,323
Well, you're just in time.
We were playing a little game.

892
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,283
She was going to destroy me.

893
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,537
And just what are you gonna do
about it?

894
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,165
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizards' duel?

895
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,335
As you wish, Madam.

896
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,421
Well, come on. Step outside.

897
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,423
After you, Madam.

898
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,647
What... What's up, boy?
What's going on?

899
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,191
They're having a wizards' duel.
What's that?

900
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,860
It's a battle of wits.

901
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,612
The players change themselves
to different things

902
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:32,409
- and attempt to destroy one another.
- De... Destroy?

903
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,661
Just watch, boy. You'll get the idea.

904
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,166
First, if you don't mind,

905
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,044
- I'll make the rules.
- Rules, indeed.

906
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,589
She only wants rules
so she can break them.

907
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,009
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.

908
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,429
Rule one, no mineral or vegetable.

909
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:53,763
Only animal.

910
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:58,768
Rule two, no make-believe things
like, pink dragons and stuff.

911
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,063
Rule three, no disappearing.

912
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,191
No. Rule four, no cheating.

913
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,903
All right, all right. Now, pace off 10.

914
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:13,074
One, two, three, four...

915
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,702
Merlin, she disappeared.

916
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,788
Mim, now, you made the rules.

917
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,138
Change to something else, Merlin.

918
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,557
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give me time to think.

919
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,937
Higgity figgity... No, no.

920
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,438
Quick, Merlin, hurry!

921
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,440
Hoppity hip.

922
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,321
Madam, just a minute.

923
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,114
This is not...

924
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,873
- Come on, something bigger.
- Something smaller.

925
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,875
Mim... Mim...

926
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,884
Merlin?

927
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,011
No disappearing.

928
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,412
Mim? Mim?

929
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,790
Are you... What's going on here?

930
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,167
You... You big blimp.

931
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,848
Squash me, will ya?

932
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,689
Merlin.

933
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,152
Bravo.

934
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,907
Just you wait, just you wait.
You're gonna pay.

935
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:37,343
So, you want to play rough, do you?

936
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,389
All right, Merlin.

937
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,101
I'll smash you good, you old crab.

938
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,562
Jehoshaphat.

939
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,109
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.

940
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,113
Merlin, you wouldn't dare.

941
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,282
Merlin!

942
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,961
Now, Mim, Mim,
no dragons, remember?

943
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,007
Did I say no purple dragons? Did I?

944
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,108
I win, I win!

945
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,945
That horrible old witch.
I'll peck her eyes out.

946
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,279
No, no.

947
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,452
- He's gone.
- Disappeared.

948
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,788
Madam, I have not disappeared.

949
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,915
I am very tiny.

950
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,252
I am a germ, a rare disease.

951
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,130
I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis.

952
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,715
And you caught me, Mim.

953
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,175
What?

954
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,887
First, you break out into spots.

955
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,394
Followed by hot and cold flashes.

956
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,981
Then violent sneezing.

957
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,404
Watch it, boy.

958
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,781
You, you, you...

959
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,159
You sneaky old scoundrel!

960
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,170
It's not too serious, Madam.
You should recover in a few weeks

961
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:39,132
and be as good...
I mean, as bad, as ever.

962
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,467
But I would suggest plenty of rest

963
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,555
and lots and lots of sunshine.

964
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,516
I hate sunshine.

965
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:52,729
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!

966
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,522
I hate it, I hate it!

967
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,150
I hate, hate, hate...

968
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,529
You were really great, Merlin.
But you could have been killed.

969
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,782
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned something from it.

970
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,286
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.

971
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,998
Right you are, Wart.
So, stick to your schooling, boy.

972
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,709
Don't worry. I will, sir. I will.

973
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,127
I really will.

974
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,674
We will sing
all night and all day

975
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:27,013
We will fight for the blue oak tree
On a field of white

976
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,057
For the blue oak tree

977
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:34,562
On a field of white

978
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:44,280
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay.

979
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,700
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.

980
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,371
Of course, son, of course.

981
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,206
Here's to Sir Kay.

982
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,085
And who knows?
The future king of all England.

983
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,337
Watch it, will ya?

984
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,214
Kay the king?

985
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,758
What a dreadful thought.

986
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:08,179
Sir Ector, Sir Ector,
Hobbs has come down with the mumps.

987
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,433
He's all puffed up like a toad.

988
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,645
Then Kay will need another squire,
hang it all.

989
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:18,690
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

990
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,442
Kay's squire. You're going to London.

991
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:24,195
Sir Ector! Wha... Wait. Whoa!

992
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,201
Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin!

993
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,164
Merlin, look! I'm a squire.

994
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,880
Very nice, boy.

995
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,799
Yes, indeed.

996
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:48,886
A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.

997
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,347
It's what all squires wear.

998
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,434
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.

999
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,602
I thought you had a few brains!

1000
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,106
Great future.

1001
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:04,944
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.

1002
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,655
Congratulations, boy!

1003
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,241
What do you want me to be?

1004
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,160
I'm nobody. You...

1005
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,663
You don't know a thing
about what's going on today.

1006
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,499
I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.

1007
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,338
Of all the idiotic... I...

1008
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,298
Blow me to Bermuda!

1009
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,643
- Where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.

1010
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,772
- Where's that?
- An island way off somewhere

1011
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:44,776
- that hasn't been discovered yet.
- Will he ever come back?

1012
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,612
Who knows? Who knows anything?

1013
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,453
For the crown of all England,

1014
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,872
let the tournament begin!

1015
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,103
Kay! Now, it's up to the swords.

1016
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,480
Swords? Swords?

1017
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,315
Oh, no!

1018
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,901
- Kay.
- What? What?

1019
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,488
I... I forgot your sword.

1020
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,032
Forgot my sword!

1021
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,035
I... I left it back at the inn.

1022
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,747
Why, you bungling little fool!

1023
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,251
You'd better get it,
or don't you dare come back!

1024
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:50,258
Let me in, let me in!

1025
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,636
Somebody, please! Please let me in!

1026
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,889
It's no use, boy,
they've all gone to the tournament.

1027
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,768
What will I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

1028
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,813
Look, boy. Look.
There in the churchyard.

1029
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:07,024
A sword. Archimedes. A sword!

1030
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,279
You're gonna have a time pulling it out.

1031
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,115
Watch it, boy.

1032
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,625
Better leave it alone.

1033
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:28,171
But Kay's got to have a sword.

1034
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,800
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here.

1035
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:38,306
You're up next, son. Better get ready.

1036
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,516
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

1037
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:46,022
- This is not my sword.
- Hold on, Kay.

1038
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,523
Wait a minute.

1039
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,776
"Whoso pulleth out this sword..."

1040
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,489
It's the sword in the stone.

1041
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:57,950
The sword in the stone? It can't be.

1042
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,285
But look, it is.

1043
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,830
- It's the marvelous sword.
- Hold everything.

1044
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,667
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone!

1045
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,670
Where did you get it, Wart?

1046
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,049
I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone

1047
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,675
in, in a churchyard.

1048
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,723
The lad's a young Samson.

1049
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,643
You're making a fool of us, boy.

1050
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,771
- Now, tell the truth.
- But I did, sir.

1051
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:30,107
Then come on. Prove it.
To the stone with you.

1052
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,735
Yes, prove it.

1053
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,029
Come on! Prove it!

1054
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:45,373
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.

1055
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,213
Now, wait a minute.

1056
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:55,883
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.

1057
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:01,055
Go to it, Kay. Give it all you've got.

1058
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,100
Put your back into it.

1059
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,019
- Get out.
- Push him aside.

1060
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,733
- Hold on. That's not fair.
- I say we let the boy try it.

1061
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:16,070
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.

1062
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,905
Go ahead, son.

1063
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:34,630
It's a miracle, ordained by heaven.

1064
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,091
This boy is our king.

1065
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,969
Well, by Jove.

1066
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:42,930
- What's the lad's name?
- Wart.

1067
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,266
I mean, Arthur.

1068
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,226
Hail, King Arthur!

1069
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,105
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the King!

1070
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,609
I can't believe it.

1071
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,820
Forgive me, son.

1072
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,741
- Forgive me.
- Please don't, sir.

1073
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,744
Kay, bow down to your king.

1074
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,462
So, at last,
the miracle had come to pass

1075
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,632
in that far-off time
upon New Year's Day.

1076
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:22,053
And the glorious reign
of King Arthur was begun.

1077
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,475
I can't be a king, Archimedes.

1078
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:30,144
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.

1079
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:34,106
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

1080
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,151
I'll run away, that's what I'll do.

1081
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,699
- They'll have to get somebody else.
- Better take the side door.

1082
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,534
Out the side door.

1083
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,833
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the king!

1084
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,381
There's another door over there.
Over there, come on. Come on.

1085
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,136
Long live King Arthur!

1086
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,013
Long live...

1087
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,684
Looks like we're surrounded, boy.

1088
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:13,104
Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.

1089
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,609
Merlin! Merlin!

1090
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,324
Merlin, you're back from Ber... Ber...

1091
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,660
Bermuda? Yes.

1092
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,288
Back from Bermuda
and the 20th century.

1093
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,668
And believe me, you can have it.

1094
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,546
One big modern mess.

1095
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,589
Alakazam.

1096
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:45,302
- I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king.
- He pulled the sword from the stone.

1097
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,889
Of course, of course.

1098
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:52,935
King Arthur
and his Knights of the Round Table.

1099
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:56,856
- "Round Table"?
- Would you rather have a square one?

1100
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,150
Oh, no. Round will be fine.

1101
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,903
Boy, boy, boy.

1102
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:05,114
You'll become a great legend.

1103
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:09,410
They'll be writing books about you
for centuries to come.

1104
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,246
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

1105
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,249
Motion picture?

1106
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:20,212
Well, that's something like television.

1107
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,299
Without commercials.

1108
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:29,847
Hail, King Arthur
Long live the king

1108
01:19:30,305 --> 01:20:30,498
