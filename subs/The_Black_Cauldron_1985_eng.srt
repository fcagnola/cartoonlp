00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,778
<i>Legend has it,
in the mystic land of Prydain,</i>

3
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:31,532
<i>there was once a king
so cruel and so evil</i>

4
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,035
<i>that even the gods feared him.</i>

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,329
<i>Since no prison could hold him,</i>

6
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>he was thrown alive
into a crucible of molten iron.</i>

7
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,087
<i>There, his demonic spirit was captured</i>

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,883
<i>in the form of a great Black Cauldron.</i>

9
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>For uncounted centuries,
the Black Cauldron lay hidden,</i>

10
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,933
<i>waiting while evil men searched for it.</i>

11
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>Knowing whoever possessed it</i>

12
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,857
<i>would have the power to resurrect
an army of deathless warriors.</i>

13
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>And with them,</i>

14
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,695
<i>rule the world.</i>

15
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,895
There's something wrong.

16
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,648
I can feel it in my bones.

17
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,819
The Fairfolk know it too.
You don't see any of them around.

18
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,864
The Horned King.

19
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,910
That black-hearted devil!

20
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,621
What's he waiting for?

21
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,334
Yes, Cat. I know you want your breakfast,

22
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,254
but just now, thinking is more important.

23
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,845
Taran! The pot is boiling over! Taran!

24
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,683
Oh, Dallben, I was just thinking,

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,601
what if the war's over,

26
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,603
and I never had the chance to fight?

27
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,231
And good thing, too!

28
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,400
War isn't a game.

29
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,943
People get hurt!

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,821
But I'm not afraid...

31
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,906
Yes, there you are.

32
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,950
If the Horned King ever returns,

33
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:42,079
you'll have a great deal more
to worry about than a burned finger.

34
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,334
No, Cat, that is not for you,
it's for Hen Wen.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,713
Hen Wen, Hen Wen. It's always Hen Wen!

36
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,842
And one day, my boy, you may learn why.

37
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,096
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.

38
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,015
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,019
He's so anxious.

40
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:09,106
And so blind to the dangers ahead.

41
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,528
Look, Cat. You're in luck!

42
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,655
Just enough left for you.

43
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,245
Dallben doesn't understand.

44
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,875
I'm not a little boy anymore.

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,590
I should be doing heroic deeds
for Prydain.

46
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,426
Not waiting hand and foot on a spoiled...

47
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,831
Hey!

48
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,555
All right, Hen.

49
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,015
I didn't mean it.

50
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,560
You'd better eat it.

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,562
Dallben made it especially for you.

52
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,947
Is this to be my life?

53
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,282
Pampering a pig?

54
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,285
I'm a warrior, not a pig keeper!

55
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,580
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid,
but I wouldn't.

56
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,375
All I need is a... is a chance,

57
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,543
and I could be a famous warrior!

58
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,505
Look at me, Hen!

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,257
I can do it!

60
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,806
Even you're afraid!

61
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,808
Do you challenge me?

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,685
Run, you cowards!

63
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,151
There you are!

64
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,779
His majesty, the Horned King!

65
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,865
We meet at last.

66
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,828
Even the Horned King shakes with fear.

67
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,455
See? Everybody runs from the famous

68
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,916
Taran of Caer Dallben...

69
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,049
Prydain's finest warrior...

70
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,428
draws his last...

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,138
Breath.

72
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,231
Dallben!

73
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,028
Not quite the grave for a hero.

74
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,448
I was... it's just that we were...

75
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,742
Hen Wen got dirty.

76
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,036
I see.

77
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,663
Another dream, Taran?

78
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,749
But Dallben,

79
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,918
won't I ever be anything
but an assistant pig keeper?

80
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,046
She's a special pig, Taran.

81
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,553
Now give her a nice bath.

82
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,139
Well, Hen,

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,559
it looks as though
I'll still be an assistant pig keeper

84
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,478
when I'm as old as Dallben.

85
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,982
You like that, don't you?

86
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,027
Now for the part you like best.

87
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,206
Hey, come on, Hen,

88
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,999
I haven't finished scrubbing your...

89
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,043
Hen! What's the matter?

90
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,337
Calm down! Stop it, please!

91
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,464
What's the matter?

92
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,092
Taran! What's going on?

93
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,094
I... I don't know.

94
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,096
There's something wrong with Hen Wen.

95
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,389
What?

96
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,350
Quickly, lad! Bring her inside.

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,485
What's that for?

98
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,362
Put Hen Wen down.

99
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,865
I never use her powers unless I have to,

100
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,326
but now, I must.

101
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,577
Powers?

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,456
Taran, what you are about to see,

103
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,501
you must never reveal to anyone.

104
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,549
<i>Hen Wen, from you I do beseech</i>

105
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,885
<i>Knowledge that lies beyond my reach</i>

106
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,389
<i>Troubled thoughts weigh on your heart</i>

107
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,059
<i>Pray you now those thoughts impart</i>

108
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:34,788
The Horned King!

109
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,544
Don't interfere.

110
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,381
He is searching.

111
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,147
The Black Cauldron!

112
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,649
So that's it!

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,026
The Black Cauldron?

114
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,196
An awesome weapon, Taran.

115
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,364
It's been hidden for centuries.

116
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,952
But if the Horned King should find it
and unleash its power,

117
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,497
nothing could stand against him.

118
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,751
- That's Hen Wen!
- He knows.

119
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,504
Stop! Enough!

120
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,757
You must leave here at once.

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,719
Take Hen Wen to the hidden cottage
at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.

122
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,806
Hide there, and never bring her out
until I come for you.

123
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,601
Hide? But why?

124
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,688
Only I knew the secret of Hen Wen's power,

125
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,317
but now the Horned King
has discovered it.

126
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:50,322
We must make sure he never uses it
to find the Black Cauldron.

127
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,741
I'm not afraid of the Horned King!

128
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,910
Then you are a very foolish lad.

129
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,915
Untried courage is no match for his evil.

130
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,625
Just remember that.

131
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,587
Now, off you go, my boy.

132
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,173
And take care of yourself?

133
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,842
Goodbye, Dallben.

134
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,971
I won't fail you.

135
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,314
So much, so soon...

136
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,111
to rest on his young shoulders.

137
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,503
Oh, yes.

138
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,007
Yes, my soldiers.

139
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,928
Soon the Black Cauldron will be mine!

140
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:43,143
Its evil power will course
through my veins.

141
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,065
And I shall make you...

142
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,485
cauldron born.

143
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,033
Yes, yes! Oh, yes!

144
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,411
Then, you will worship me!

145
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,040
Me.

146
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh, my soldiers,

147
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:15,842
how long I've thirsted to be a god...

148
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,472
among mortal men.

149
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,815
Gosh, Hen Wen.

150
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,776
I never knew you could
create visions and things like that.

151
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,529
I thought you were just an ordinary pig.

152
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,534
I had no idea you were so... special.

153
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,829
Dallben's going to be glad
he put his trust in me,

154
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,634
just you wait and see!

155
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,958
No, don't go wandering about.

156
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,585
Don't you worry.

157
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,255
Keep close to me
and no one will do you any harm.

158
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,841
Not while I'm around.

159
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,222
I won't let the Horned King
get close to you, Hen.

160
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,849
I'll protect you.

161
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,815
<i>Taran of Caer Dallben,</i>

162
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,569
<i>the greatest warrior in all Prydain!</i>

163
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,488
<i>A true hero!</i>

164
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,785
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all.

165
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,581
But without the help
of my pig, Hen Wen here, I...

166
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,957
Hen Wen?

167
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,542
Where are you?

168
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,960
Hen Wen?

169
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,629
Oh, no!

170
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,967
Hen?

171
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,725
Hen Wen!

172
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,525
Is that you, Hen?

173
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,488
Look what I've got.

174
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,198
Come on out.

175
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,533
- Here's a lovely...!
- Yaa-haa!

176
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:12,417
Great prince give poor starving Gurgi
munchings and crunchings.

177
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,960
Nice apple.

178
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,421
Good prince! Good apple!

179
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,341
Oh, boy, what a juicy apple!

180
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,931
Hey! No, you don't!
I didn't give you that apple!

181
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,516
You took it.

182
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,562
Hey! Hold on, you hairy little thief!
Come back with my apple!

183
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,774
If you don't give it back,
you'll be sorry!

184
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,400
I mean it.

185
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,153
I'm warning you.

186
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,281
Give it back!

187
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,664
Come on.

188
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,624
The apple. Where is it?

189
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,044
Gurgi not know where the...

190
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,633
Give it back. I warn you.

191
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,303
Come on.

192
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,352
Come on, the apple. Let's have it.

193
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,651
You horrible greedy thing.

194
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,487
You should be ashamed of yourself.

195
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:27,659
Poor miserable Gurgi deserves
fierce smackings and wackings

196
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,328
on his poor tender head.

197
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,332
Always left with no munchings
and crunchings!

198
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,588
Forgive poor Gurgi!

199
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,090
Stop that sniveling!

200
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,718
I'm not going to hurt you. Now look here!

201
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,553
Have you seen my pig?

202
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,888
Piggy?

203
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,891
Round, fat piggy?

204
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,476
Big snout!

205
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,770
- Yes. Yes.
- Curly tail?

206
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,439
That's her! That's Hen Wen.

207
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,192
Nope. Gurgi not seen piggy. Nope.

208
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,111
Never mind!

209
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,197
No telling where Hen Wen is by now!

210
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,912
Master, master!
Now Gurgi remembers! Yes, yes!

211
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,958
Clever sharp-eyed Gurgi
saw the piggy run... yes!

212
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,418
Right through the forest!

213
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,046
I saw it, I saw it.

214
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,466
Come! Gurgi will find the lost piggy!

215
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,551
Then we'll be friends forever!

216
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,306
Munchings and crunchings
in here somewhere!

217
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,352
It's Hen Wen! She's in trouble!

218
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,312
Goodbye!

219
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,606
Hen Wen!

220
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,192
Hen!

221
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,699
Hen Wen!

222
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,921
Hen Wen, look out!

223
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,680
Look out!

224
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,476
Come on, hurry, Hen!

225
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,938
No! No! Hen, hurry!

226
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,027
No! Don't!

227
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,279
No!

228
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,240
No!

229
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,494
No! Come back!

230
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,746
Please!

231
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,542
No, no! Come back!

232
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,031
Hen Wen.

233
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,782
I must get her out of there!

234
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,744
Oh, no, Great Lord.

235
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,245
Not go in there.

236
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,080
Forget the piggy.

237
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,209
- What are you doing here?
- Gurgi come back to be your friend!

238
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,170
Friend?

239
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,880
You're no friend!

240
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,840
You ran away when I...

241
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,092
Never mind!

242
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,970
I promised Dallben I'd keep Hen safe!

243
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,889
I have to go!

244
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,684
Well...

245
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,977
Are you coming?

246
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,064
Me? Go in there?

247
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,859
Oh, no, no, no! It's a terrible place!

248
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,235
Just as I thought!

249
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,862
You're no friend!

250
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,448
You're just a... a miserable coward.

251
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,912
Here, this is all you wanted.

252
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,879
If Great Lord go into evil castle,

253
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,590
poor Gurgi
will never see his friend again.

254
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,134
No. Never.

255
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,535
Shut up, you thick skulled dolt!

256
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,912
Always barking at nothing!

257
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,748
All right, might as well make our rounds.

258
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,219
Here's to everybody!

259
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:42,348
More wine and beer for my men!

260
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,103
Quiet! I'm trying to sleep.

261
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,567
What about a kiss, princess?

262
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,903
You're a lovely one.

263
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,947
Here.

264
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,122
Keep your hands off, you little Creeper.

265
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,126
Going somewhere, Creeper?

266
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,051
Kiss me, love, and I'll die
with a smile on my face.

267
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,847
Welcome, Your Majesty!

268
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,142
We're just celebrating our success!

269
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,937
I mean, your success!

270
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,650
We've made no mistakes this time.

271
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,613
Bring in the prisoner!

272
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,042
There, sire!

273
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,755
This is the pig that creates visions!

274
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,465
All right, pig!

275
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,136
Show His Majesty
where the Black Cauldron can be found!

276
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,763
Go on, show it!

277
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,144
Stubborn little thing, isn't she?

278
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,608
Why yes, sire.

279
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,112
You're quite right!
I'll take care of it at once.

280
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,031
The Black Cauldron!

281
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,532
Where is it?

282
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,868
Show us, swine!

283
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,165
I warn you! The king's patience is short!

284
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,500
No! Don't!

285
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,086
No!

286
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,967
Get him!

287
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,220
Get back, or I'll...

288
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,937
- Release him!
- What?

289
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,403
Hen Wen!

290
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,367
Hen Wen. There, there.

291
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,870
I presume, my boy,

292
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,958
you are the keeper of this oracular pig.

293
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,671
Yes, sir.

294
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:06,260
Then instruct her to show me
the whereabouts...

295
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,680
of the Black Cauldron!

296
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,308
Oh, sir!

297
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,061
I can't, I promised!

298
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,313
Very well.

299
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,483
In that case, the pig is no use to me.

300
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,947
What are you going to do?

301
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,992
No! You can't!

302
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,829
Don't!

303
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,499
Don't! Stop!

304
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,169
- I'll make her tell you!
- That's better.

305
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,674
Now, get on with the visions, pig!

306
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,264
<i>Hen Wen, from you</i>

307
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,349
<i>I do beseech</i>

308
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,603
<i>Knowledge that lies beyond my reach</i>

309
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,567
Look! Look, sire!

310
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,026
It's working!

311
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,768
The Black Cauldron!

312
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,242
So, it does exist.

313
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,706
Where is it?

314
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,708
Show me.

315
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,086
Show me.

316
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:29,927
Come on, Hen!

317
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,889
After them!

318
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,099
Get them! After them!

319
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,753
Gotcha, pig boy.

320
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,350
The moat!

321
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,310
It's our only chance!

322
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,854
Come on!

323
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,238
Swim, Hen! Swim!

324
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,118
I'm coming!

325
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:41,290
Gotcha, pig boy!

326
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,503
I caught him, Your Majesty!
I caught the boy!

327
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,922
But you let the pig go, didn't you?

328
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,924
It wasn't my fault!

329
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,889
Throw the boy into the dungeon!

330
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,577
<i>You must make sure</i>

331
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,621
<i>he never uses Hen Wen
to find the Black Cauldron.</i>

332
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,791
<i>I won't fail you, Dallben.</i>

333
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:30,047
<i>Look at me, Hen. I can do it!</i>

334
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,049
<i>I can do it!</i>

335
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,471
Do it.

336
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,223
I can do it.

337
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,121
I thought I heard a noise in here.

338
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,083
Was that you?

339
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,418
Yeah. Yes.

340
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,087
You're being held a prisoner,
aren't you?

341
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,255
Yes!

342
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,382
I'm being held against my will too.

343
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,177
It lights up.

344
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,512
Why, of course! It's magic.

345
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,057
I hate this place.

346
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,851
I do hope there aren't any rats in here.

347
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,520
Not that I really mind them, you know,

348
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,939
but they do jump out at one so.

349
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,816
I'm Princess Eilonwy.

350
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,944
Are you a lord, or a warrior?

351
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,488
No...

352
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,574
I'm an assistant pig keeper.

353
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,243
What a pity.

354
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,539
I was so hoping for someone
who could help me escape!

355
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,417
Well.
If you want to come with me, you may.

356
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,585
Can I?

357
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,213
Yes. I said you could.

358
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,966
That wicked king!

359
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,885
You know, he stole me.

360
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,472
He thought my bauble could tell him
where some old cauldron was.

361
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,474
That's what he wanted my pig for.

362
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,560
Oh, yes. Your pig!

363
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,479
But my pig can tell the future!

364
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,564
How interesting!

365
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,236
Well, you better stay close to me
or you'll get lost.

366
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,545
Your bauble!

367
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,339
It's always chasing those rats!

368
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,095
A burial chamber!

369
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,349
This could be the tomb of the great king
who built this castle!

370
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,685
Before the Horned King took it over.

371
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,110
Are you all right?

372
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,865
Well, come on, then! Help me look around.

373
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,092
He must have been a great warrior!

374
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,225
A sword!

375
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,990
This will please him!

376
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,619
It's a good lot this time!

377
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,079
Hurry! In with it!

378
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,458
Finally, he'll reward me for this.

379
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,880
Don't stop, you weakling!

380
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,715
Put some muscle into it!

381
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,354
Let's get out of here
before they come back!

382
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,661
Where did you get that sword?

383
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,955
- Back there.
- You mean...

384
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,666
Well, he's not going to use it!

385
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,297
You're making
a horrendous mistake!

386
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,676
I'm not a spy! I'm a bard!

387
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,554
I sing!

388
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,973
I entertain!

389
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:54,645
Careful, sir, these are
the hands of an artist!

390
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,022
This'll hold you!

391
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:01,235
Now look, you seem an intelligent
sort of chap to me.

392
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,738
I assure you I had no idea
who owned this castle.

393
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,367
I just happened to be passing.

394
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,911
He's nice. What's his name?

395
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,917
Down!

396
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,338
You don't realize who I am!

397
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,885
I shall sing of your dastardly deed!

398
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,887
I'm Fflewddur Fflam!

399
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,014
Minstrel of minstrels!

400
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,559
Balladeer to the grandest courts
in all the land!

401
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,980
Well. So, you've forgotten.

402
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,858
I have sung in some
of the finest courts.

403
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,737
I'm only waiting for an invitation.

404
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,197
Oh, shush.

405
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,700
Why do you have to judge
every word I say?

406
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,495
Who's that?

407
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,749
Help!

408
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,167
Hello.

409
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,128
We'll have you untied in a moment.

410
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,088
I'm Princess Eilonwy.

411
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,799
And you are in bad trouble, aren't you?

412
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,343
Trouble?

413
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,388
Don't you know where you are?
Haven't you seen him?

414
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,766
Pig boy's escaped.
Look in there!

415
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,893
We've been discovered!

416
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,686
That's you?

417
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,107
Great Belin! Run! Run!

418
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,484
Make haste!

419
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,028
Make haste?

420
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,571
I must save myself!

421
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,042
Let's try down here!

422
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,512
Princess!

423
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,722
Princess Eilonwy!

424
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,353
Pig boy!

425
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,730
You little scut!

426
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,256
No, no. No!

427
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,279
Are you all right?

428
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,657
Oh, good, you're safe!

429
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,951
- Of course! I...
- Come on.

430
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,828
I'm going to get you out of here!

431
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,584
- There they are!
- Quick!

432
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:04,793
Up here!

433
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,764
Taran, the sword!

434
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,353
Help! Murder!

435
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,275
Keep going, Princess!

436
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,746
There he is! Get him!

437
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,710
Over there!

438
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:49,963
Stop him!

439
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,511
- Taran!
- There they are!

440
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,316
Come on, get them!

441
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,527
Oh, no! Taran!

442
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:16,156
We've got you now, pig boy!

443
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,035
Taran, do something!

444
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,289
Use the sword!

445
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:38,220
Make way! Make way!
Stand aside, I command you!

446
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,265
Get out from under my feet.

447
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,018
Let me go, you brute!

448
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,187
Run, Princess! Run!

449
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,107
Stay up!

450
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,239
Why didn't you tell me
you had a magic sword?

451
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,381
I'll... I'll say it wasn't my fault!

452
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,176
That's it! That's it!

453
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,679
I always get blamed for these things!

454
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,974
I'll just tell him.

455
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,602
And if he gets mad...

456
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,772
I'll just straighten him out! That's it!

457
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,525
I'm not going to be
kicked around for this!

458
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,582
Sire?

459
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,548
You bring news of the pig?

460
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,180
Not... Not exactly, sire.

461
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,809
It's the pig keeper.

462
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,978
He's... He's...

463
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,901
escaped!

464
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,284
Oh, sire!

465
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,328
Allow me!

466
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,628
Isn't that enough?

467
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,214
Good.

468
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,342
He'll find his pig.

469
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,221
Send the Gwythaints to follow that boy!

470
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,597
Yes, sire.

471
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,017
Oh, yes!

472
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,852
By all means, sire!

473
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,002
<i>The world will applaud me</i>

474
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,754
<i>Its praise will reward me</i>

475
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,134
<i>And I, Fflewddur Fflam will find fame!</i>

476
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,346
They're almost finished, Fflewddur.

477
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,475
It's not too good,
but it'll hold for a while.

478
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,437
Yes. I shall sing of your deed!

479
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,732
It would be better
to sing of our heroic escape!

480
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,526
Weren't you a bit frightened?

481
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,820
A Fflam frightened?

482
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,490
The word is not in my vocabulary!

483
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,201
But in this case well chosen, my dear.

484
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,995
I wasn't afraid.

485
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,789
Not afraid?

486
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,292
We were running for our lives!

487
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,461
I got us out of the castle, didn't I?

488
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,714
You? I'd say it was the sword's magic.

489
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,759
It takes a great warrior
to handle a sword like this!

490
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:07,137
But, still, it is a magic sword!

491
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,390
What does a girl
know about swords anyway?

492
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,683
Girl?

493
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:12,976
Girl?

494
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,520
If it weren't for this girl,

495
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,023
you would still be
in the Horned King's dungeon!

496
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,776
Here now. Princess Eilonwy, Taran...

497
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,529
At least I don't keep
talking about it forever!

498
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,240
You're so... so boring!

499
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,493
Princess Eilonwy.

500
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,536
How dare you take his side!

501
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,918
I really didn't mean to... to interfere...

502
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,586
Silly girl!

503
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,213
Even if she is a princess!

504
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,176
But we're going to have to...

505
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,139
Oh, dear.

506
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,579
Hello.

507
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,833
Hello.

508
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,420
Fflewddur is right, you know.

509
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,589
We are going to have to work together.

510
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,759
And we'll find your pig.

511
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,095
I'm sure it's important.

512
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,475
Thank you for getting me
out of the dungeon.

513
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,520
But we couldn't have
done it without you.

514
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,648
Well, at least we're all safe.

515
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,609
Great Belin!

516
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,069
Fflewddur!

517
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,321
Help! Murder!

518
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,824
Hurry!

519
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,952
Gurgi's lucky day!

520
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,957
Yes! Keep it! It's a gift!

521
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,667
This. Gurgi want this.

522
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,545
Go ahead,
I'm sure you've murdered for less!

523
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,715
Gurgi want!

524
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,594
Gurgi!

525
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,346
Master?

526
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,891
Old man, fall down.

527
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,767
Get up. Get up.

528
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,731
Well! Really!

529
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:27,277
Who is your pungent
little friend?

530
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,488
He's no friend of mine.

531
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,741
He's just a coward, and a thief.

532
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,661
Too big anyway!

533
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,378
You're charming.

534
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,256
And pungent too!

535
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,135
Well, what are you waiting for?

536
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,222
Yes! Exactly! Toddle off!

537
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,141
Gurgi go!

538
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,105
Tracks? Tracks!

539
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,317
Gurgi remember! Saw piggy's tracks!

540
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,277
- You did?
- Today!

541
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,863
Today? Wait a minute.

542
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,615
He'll try anything!

543
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,534
You're both horrid!

544
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,327
He just might know.

545
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,828
Pretty lady come, too?

546
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,705
- Well, I...
- Yes, yes, yes!

547
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,666
Follow Gurgi!

548
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,793
You better be telling the truth!

549
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,253
Gurgi not lie.

550
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,088
Not this time.

551
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,643
See, Master?

552
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,563
Piggy's footsteps! No lie.

553
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,439
Good.

554
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,983
They look fresh.

555
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,202
Master!

556
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,788
Master!

557
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,125
Gurgi! Hold on.

558
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,836
Oh, no! Taran!

559
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,546
Give me your hand!

560
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,881
We're doomed!

561
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,914
How did they get in here?

562
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,710
Old Doli's whirlpool broke again!

563
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,796
I bet they wake up soon.

564
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,425
- We'd better tell King Eidilleg.
- No, silly!

565
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,927
You know we're not supposed
to be up here!

566
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,889
We're all going to be in trouble.

567
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,223
Not me!

568
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,100
Me either!

569
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,778
Oh, yes. I see you fixed that.

570
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,071
Yep!

571
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,238
When...

572
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:22,535
I get this last peg in here...

573
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,621
I'll be finished!

574
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:30,001
Good. That should work.

575
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,378
It's perfect.

576
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,546
Grab that pole!

577
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,964
I've got it!

578
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,935
Aren't you all darling!

579
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,562
Hello.

580
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:52,273
I'm King Eidilleg of the Fairfolk.

581
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,776
How the blazes did they...

582
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,742
I thought I told you
to fix the whirlpool!

583
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,913
I did... I did fix it! It was perfect!

584
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,165
Evidently not completely perfect.

585
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,043
It's supposed to keep them out!

586
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,170
Can I be of any service?

587
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,965
Is everything that happens
around here my fault?

588
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,676
Are you here on a friendly visit?

589
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,679
And I suppose it's my fault
the pig's here, too!

590
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,598
- Hen Wen?
- She's your pig!

591
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,058
Oh, good.

592
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,229
One less thing for old Doli
to worry about!

593
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:35,108
- Doli!
- What now?

594
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,986
- Would you hurry and fetch the pig?
- Pig?

595
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,033
Hey, you kids! What are you doing?

596
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,871
Mr. Doli.
I just want to see the pretty lady.

597
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,082
You watch yourselves, hear?

598
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,357
I can't believe my eyes, Your Majesty!

599
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,456
- Watch it!
- Oh, Hen!

600
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,667
Thank goodness you're...

601
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:44,677
Tell me, is the burning and killing
still going on up there?

602
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:49,098
You refer to that joke on humanity,
the Horned King!

603
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,601
No one ever stands up to him!

604
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,063
We've seen him.
And if he finds the cauldron...

605
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,774
he'll kill us all!

606
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,443
Oh, no, no. He'll never find it.

607
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,613
No, no. It's safely hidden, in Morva.

608
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,073
Morva?

609
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,952
Well, at least I think it is.

610
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,329
Doli, is it?

611
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,540
Really?

612
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,708
Is that one of my new jobs?

613
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:18,461
Remembering where the cauldron
was last seen?

614
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,800
He'll know right where it is. You'll see.

615
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,970
If we could get to the cauldron first,

616
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,180
and destroy it...

617
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:32,350
- This isn't right, Taran.
- But don't you see?

618
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,519
If we destroy the cauldron,

619
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,813
it will stop the Horned King!

620
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,775
Please, come with me?

621
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,071
Wait, I never thought... Morva!
That's a hard place to get to!

622
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,239
Yep!

623
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:48,825
- You can take them.
- What?

624
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:52,579
We're trusting our lives to him?

625
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,582
And what is wrong with me?

626
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,294
Nothing. Splendid choice.

627
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,547
Shall we then?

628
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,526
Wait! Hen Wen.

629
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,739
Don't worry. We'll get her home safely.

630
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,866
Thank you, sir.

631
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,868
Be good, Hen.

632
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,934
Well, if it's the Marshes of Morva
you wanted, here you are.

633
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,479
Such a dreary place.

634
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:03,399
Let's see what it looks like from up here.

635
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,862
I think we're lost.

636
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,076
Are you sure
this is the right place, Doli?

637
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,912
Yes, I'm sure!

638
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,415
Well, if... if you ask me...

639
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:26,172
- Fflewddur! Doli!
- Are you all right?

640
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,549
Look out, you big clumsy oaf!

641
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,969
Look where you're...

642
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,722
Welcome to Morva.

643
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,853
Well, someone must live here.

644
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,523
Gurgi not like this place!

645
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,985
No.

646
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,988
It seems empty.
Maybe we should have a look.

647
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,743
If I could just get this door open.

648
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:03,876
How will we ever find
the Black Cauldron in a place like this?

649
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,462
It must be here somewhere.

650
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,945
They're only frogs, Eilonwy.

651
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,905
Those were people!

652
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,324
You mean, they were turned into frogs?

653
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,703
Master, come quickly!

654
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,705
Gurgi found the wicked cauldron!

655
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,081
Quick! Follow Gurgi!

656
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,127
Behold, Master!

657
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,714
The whole room is full of cauldrons!

658
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,175
I don't understand!

659
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,595
Why would anyone want so many...

660
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,723
Thieves! Thieves!

661
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,226
Someone stole all our frogs!

662
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,441
You evil, nasty people!

663
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:12,403
You shall all be turned
into frogs and eaten!

664
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:18,868
Nice and tender!

665
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,914
Stop that, you...

666
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,333
So nice to meet you, ladies.

667
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,629
- Goodbye!
- Wait! My!

668
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,632
Aren't you the handsome one!

669
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,009
Who? Me?

670
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,053
Honestly now!

671
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,139
Don't you find me irresistible?

672
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:41,891
Yes.

673
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,769
Shush! Stop that!

674
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,771
You don't mind if I...

675
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,648
pluck your harp?

676
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,860
- Well...
- Do you, handsome?

677
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,114
Enough of this lovesick nonsense!

678
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,450
Great Belin!

679
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,789
We're going to have toad stew!

680
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,633
You're not gonna eat this one!

681
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,221
Come here, love!

682
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,974
Can anyone here perform marriages?

683
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,559
Marriages?

684
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,686
You love-struck witch!

685
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,439
Where is he?

686
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,525
Where'd he go?

687
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,738
Where are you? Don't go!

688
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,491
Now look what you've done!

689
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,868
He's gone!

690
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,662
I'll never forgive you for this, Orgoch!

691
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,080
Never!

692
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:48,958
There you are!

693
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,053
Enough! We've come for the Black Cauldron!

694
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,723
Did you hear that, sisters?

695
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,269
Nobody's asked for the Black Cauldron
in over 2,000 years!

696
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,021
It's a trick!

697
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,981
We're not going
to let them have it, are we?

698
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,482
Don't worry.

699
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,027
Leave it to me.

700
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:20,031
Perhaps I might interest you
in something else.

701
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,534
A kettle, a cook pot, a skillet,

702
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,871
a teapot, a bucket, a jar, a platter!

703
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,625
See anything you like?

704
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,798
I don't believe it!

705
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,935
I've never seen a sword like that!

706
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:55,066
I've got to have that sword!

707
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,318
Listen carefully.

708
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,239
We'll trade the cauldron for the sword!

709
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,742
But what can they do
with the cauldron, Orddu?

710
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:05,993
Nothing!

711
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,370
That's the point.

712
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:10,539
Don't you see? We'll end up with both!

713
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,334
The sword and the cauldron!

714
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:16,504
It's decided, then,

715
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,297
you shall have the Black Cauldron.

716
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,634
You mean, you'll give it to us?

717
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,304
That's not what I said.

718
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,265
You weren't listening.

719
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,225
We never give anything away.

720
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:33,938
What we do is bargain, trade!

721
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,815
You'll not have my sword!

722
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:43,114
May I ask you ladies to perhaps
consider this magnificent harp?

723
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:44,699
A harp?

724
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,035
When we want music, we send for the birds.

725
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,746
What would we do with a simple harp?

726
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,207
Wait!

727
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,752
Gurgi will trade
his munchings and crunchings.

728
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,212
Who would want...

729
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,840
Hold it, sister! Not so fast!

730
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,844
All right!

731
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,096
I know what you want!

732
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,806
Yes?

733
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:11,350
No, Taran! No!

734
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,102
It's our only chance!

735
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,189
Here is my sword.

736
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,025
Take it!

737
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,819
Is it your own choice, duckling?

738
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,364
Remember, with this sword,

739
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:28,826
you could be the greatest of warriors.

740
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,161
Yes.

741
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,955
I offer my dearest possession

742
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:36,500
in exchange for the Black Cauldron.

743
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,837
Agreed! We have made a bargain.

744
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:54,143
Look out!

745
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,813
Help!

746
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,445
Taran, watch out!

747
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:07,615
Great Belin!

748
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,618
Duck!

749
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,181
Look!

750
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:54,954
The Black Cauldron!

751
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,164
It's ours!

752
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:04,338
I say, what funny little ducklings!

753
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:09,343
Don't they know the Black Cauldron
is indestructible?

754
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,179
Now listen carefully.

755
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:16,016
The Black Cauldron can never be destroyed.

756
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,687
Only its evil powers can be stopped!

757
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,605
Then there is a way!

758
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:22,982
But how?

759
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,360
A living being must climb into it

760
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:28,946
of his own free will!

761
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:32,992
Gurgi is bold and brave.
He will climb into the evil cauldron.

762
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:38,664
However, the poor duckling
will never climb out alive.

763
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,000
Yikes!

764
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:45,004
Look here, madam.
Don't forget we had an agreement!

765
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,673
Yes, you said we could have the cauldron.

766
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:50,301
Of course we said
you could have the cauldron.

767
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:53,095
It's not our fault
you can't do anything with it.

768
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,312
Goodbye, goslings!

769
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,150
And remember,
we always keep a bargain!

770
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:24,376
What a bunch of blundering misfits!

771
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,422
Things never work out
when you're dealing with people.

772
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:31,967
You can go back to feeding pigs.
I've had it!

773
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,469
Goodbye!

774
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:37,890
Doli's right.

775
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,100
It's... It's my fault.

776
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,769
I let you down.

777
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,729
Without my sword, I'm nothing!

778
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,441
I'm just... an assistant pig keeper.

779
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,902
Look, you are somebody.

780
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,696
You must believe in yourself.

781
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,950
I believe in you.

782
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,576
You do?

783
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,496
And I think that you're...

784
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,998
I mean...

785
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,876
- That is...
- Yes, Taran?

786
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,169
I mean...

787
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:15,261
What I mean is I'm grateful to all of you.

788
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,179
You've been true friends.

789
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:18,764
Now it's up to me...

790
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,184
Look!

791
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:25,479
Trouble! Goodbye.

792
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,190
Quick! We can't let them find it!

793
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,985
Pig boy!

794
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,538
Finally, you're ours, pig boy!

795
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,467
Get a move on! Careful now!

796
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,931
You, tie them up over there
and get that cart out of here!

797
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,144
I'm sorry.

798
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,271
I've ignored you.

799
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,692
You did come for the Black Cauldron,
didn't you?

800
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,778
Good, then climb in!

801
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:19,116
It will only cost you your life.

802
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,709
Everything is ready, sire!

803
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:34,798
My, such a brave and handsome crew!

804
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:38,510
A pig boy, a scullery maid

805
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,513
and a broken-down minstrel!

806
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:47,102
Perhaps it may interest you
to see what fate has in store for you!

807
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:56,153
Now I call on my army of the dead!

808
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:00,032
The cauldron-born!

809
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,997
Arise, my messengers of death!

810
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:12,127
Our time has arrived!

811
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,903
It's horrible!

812
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:25,701
My beloved warriors
have come to life!

813
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,538
All the dead of centuries past!

814
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:34,042
Never has anyone created
an army like this!

815
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:41,258
Go forth, my deathless warriors!

816
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,970
Destroy all in your path!

817
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,267
Come, sire!
We can get a better view from above!

818
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:52,978
Oh, Taran.

819
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,940
I'm afraid it'll soon be over for us.

820
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,233
I...

821
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,944
I hadn't planned it
to end like this, Eilonwy.

822
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:04,281
I wish I'd stayed a toad.

823
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,665
Only moments away from victory.

824
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,128
My greatest triumph!

825
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,465
We did it, sire! We did it!

826
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,176
I... I... I mean, you!

827
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,429
Yes, of course. You did it, sire!

828
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:39,775
Yikes!

829
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:46,198
Gurgi? Gurgi, is that you?

830
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,116
Master!

831
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,535
Gurgi!

832
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,870
What are you doing here?

833
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:56,375
Gurgi sorry he always runs away
when there's trouble.

834
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:00,796
He will untie everybody.

835
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,465
Then we all leave this evil place!

836
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,634
Get on with it!

837
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,845
Good boy, Gurgi!

838
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,848
Eilonwy, you and Fflewddur go with Gurgi.

839
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,851
I must stop the cauldron.

840
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,271
But Taran, that's impossible!

841
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,022
Why, you'd be...

842
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:21,984
- Taran!
- I'm sorry, Eilonwy.

843
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,152
Please, Taran!

844
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,863
No! You can't.

845
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,614
My mind is made up.

846
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,032
Wait, Master.

847
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,326
Gurgi not let you jump into cauldron!

848
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,913
Gurgi, get out of my way!

849
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,669
Please, Master!

850
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:42,963
Not go into evil cauldron.

851
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,591
If I don't, we're all lost!

852
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:46,967
Out of my way!

853
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,845
No, Gurgi not let his friend die.

854
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,224
Taran has many friends.

855
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,645
Gurgi has no friends.

856
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,647
Gurgi! No!

857
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,774
Don't jump! Wait!

858
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,109
No!

859
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,444
No!

860
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,533
No!

861
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,757
Oh, sire.

862
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,508
Sire, look!

863
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:30,260
Something's wrong!

864
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,804
What is it, sire?

865
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,765
They're dying!

866
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,934
It can't be!

867
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,480
This had better not be your fault!

868
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,068
It needs another body, sire!

869
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:49,738
Yes! Yours!

870
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:58,538
Get Eilonwy out of here. Hurry!

871
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,708
- Taran, please, I...
- Go on!

872
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:02,960
Go with Fflewddur!

873
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,839
Maybe there's still a chance for Gurgi.

874
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:30,946
No, sire! Please!

875
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:32,823
Get up.

876
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,450
Come alive!

877
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,078
Maybe they're only resting, sire.

878
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:40,956
Do something!

879
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,083
My life is at stake.

880
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,627
Get up, you fools.

881
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:47,337
Kill!

882
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,881
Look! Sire, look!

883
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,134
It's the pig boy.

884
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,928
It's his fault. Yes!

885
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:56,722
He's the cause of it.

886
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,726
You've interfered for the last time.

887
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:03,478
Go for his throat, sire.

888
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,480
Now, pig keeper,

889
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,108
you shall die!

890
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,745
What's this?

891
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,292
No, you'll not escape!

892
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:32,758
You shall satisfy the cauldron's hunger.

893
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,511
Oh, no.

894
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,393
No!

895
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,812
You'll not have me.

896
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,650
My power cannot die!

897
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,279
Curse you!

898
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,120
No!

899
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,346
Oh, no!

900
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,307
How... How horrible!

901
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,018
Poor sire!

902
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,522
He's gone!

903
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,275
He's gone?

904
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:35,070
He's gone!

905
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:37,864
He's gone!

906
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,375
Fflewddur!

907
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,753
Eilonwy!

908
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,047
Over here! Hurry!

909
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,467
Thank goodness you're safe!

910
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,678
Come on, Fflewddur! Hurry!

911
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,474
Run for your lives!

912
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,358
Come on, jump!

913
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,954
Taran, look!

914
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,540
Quick, get in.

915
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,417
Let's go.

916
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,460
Here, push off, Fflewddur!

917
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,423
Trouble!

918
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:40,093
We can't get through!

919
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,054
I'll try to open the gate.

920
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,098
Taran, be careful, please!

921
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,606
Hurry, move on through!

922
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,317
Come on, Fflewddur! Hurry!

923
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,694
Good work, lad!

924
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,489
Look out!

925
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,021
Gurgi...

926
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,569
Gurgi.

927
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:23,530
Why is the poor duckling so sad?

928
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,700
Yes, he's got what he wanted,

929
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,452
and he's still not satisfied.

930
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,623
Just what do you think
you're up to, ladies?

931
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,127
We have business with your little hero.

932
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,378
Hero?

933
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:41,298
Gurgi was the hero.

934
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,677
The only thing that mattered
to you was the cauldron.

935
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:49,139
But now it's no use to you.

936
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,266
So, we'll just take it,

937
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:52,892
and be on our way!

938
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,602
Wait! Wait!

939
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,022
Stay your hand, ladies!

940
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:00,025
We never give anything away.

941
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,528
We bargain. We trade.

942
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,696
Remember?

943
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:10,201
Did these old ears
hear the word bargain?

944
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:14,247
Yes, madam. Those old ears heard right.

945
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,835
I adore a forceful man!

946
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:22,505
Pull yourself together, madam.

947
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:25,008
Now, come on, out with it!

948
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,509
What is your offer?

949
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,554
- No! Not...
- Then I'll do it!

950
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:37,228
A magnificent sword for a warrior!

951
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,823
I'm not a warrior.

952
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:50,992
I'm a pig boy.

953
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,329
What would I do with a sword?

954
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,123
Absolutely nothing!

955
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,543
- But I would trade.
- Yes?

956
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,754
The cauldron...

957
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:05,340
for Gurgi.

958
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,094
- Oh, dear!
- It's not possible!

959
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,514
Just as I thought, ladies!

960
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,724
You've got no real power!

961
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,602
Admit it! Admit it!

962
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:33,368
We have made a bargain!

963
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,750
Oh, Taran.

964
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:49,360
Munchings and crunchings
in here somewhere.

965
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:50,612
Gurgi!

966
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,323
You're alive!

967
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,325
He's alive!

968
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,292
Great Belin!

969
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,620
He is alive!

970
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,582
Oh, Fflewddur, Fflewddur, he's alive!

971
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:04,751
I'm alive!

972
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:05,919
Gurgi's alive!

973
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:07,962
Look! Touch me!

974
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:12,425
You clever little thing!

975
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,267
Come on, Gurgi.

976
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,852
Let's go home.

977
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,106
Gurgi's happy day!

978
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,407
Great Belin!

979
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:55,009
You did well, my boy!

980
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,804
Yep!

980
01:15:58,305 --> 01:16:58,831
