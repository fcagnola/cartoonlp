00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,392
<i>Your dreams</i>

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,358
<i>Come true</i>

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,797
Pretty, huh?

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,593
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,678
About a wish coming true,
do you?

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,711
Well, I didn't either.

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,513
Of course, I'm just
a cricket singing my way
from hearth to hearth...

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,679
but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,471
One night, a long time--

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,196
Pardon me. Wait 'til I, I fix
this thing here. There.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,630
One night, a long time ago,

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,672
my travels took me to
a quaint little village.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,597
It was a beautiful night.

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,756
The stars were shining
like diamonds...

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,792
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

34
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,751
Pretty as a picture.

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,356
As I wandered along
the crooked streets,

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,675
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,234
The only sign of life
was a lighted window...

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,670
in the shop of a wood-carver
named, uh, Geppetto.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,075
So, I hopped over.

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,957
And looked in.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,119
It was a shame to see a nice
cheerful fire like that
going to waste.

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,515
So what do I do?

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,557
I go in.

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,837
I looked around.

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,669
Of course, being in
a strange place like that,

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,189
I didn't know what to expect.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,754
A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,469
Soon as I saw there was no one
about, I made myself at home.

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,753
As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,792
Well, sir, you never saw
such a place.

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,957
The most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,514
And all carved out of wood.

53
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,428
And cute little music boxes,
each one a work of art.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,835
Shelf after shelf of toys and--

55
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,196
And then something else
caught my eye.

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,117
A puppet!

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,276
You know, one of those
marionette things,

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,197
all strings and joints.

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,350
Cute little fella.

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,153
Ding, ding! Going up?

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,157
Good piece of wood too.

62
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,396
Well, now.

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,114
It won't take much longer.

64
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,313
Just a little more paint
and he's all finished.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,392
I think he'll be all right.

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,114
Don't you, Figaro?

67
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,638
Um, huh, uh, beg pardon.

68
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,311
See? That makes
a big difference.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,793
Very good.

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,912
Very, very goo--

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,675
Well, you can't
please everybody.

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,199
Now, I have just
the name for you.

73
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,993
Pinocchio!

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,315
Do you like it, Figaro?

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,634
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,756
Well, we'll leave it
to little Woodenhead.

77
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,677
Do you like it?

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,271
That settles it!

79
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,516
Pinocchio it is!

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,835
Come on, now,
we'll try you out.

81
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,757
Music, Professor!

82
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,399
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!
Ta-Ta-Take it easy there!

83
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,318
Oh, break it up, will you?

84
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,476
Lot of downbeats in there.

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,111
<i>Little Woodenhead</i>
<i>Go play your part</i>

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,312
<i>Bring a littlejoy</i>
<i>to every heart</i>

87
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,512
<i>Little do you know</i>
<i>and yet it's true</i>

88
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,712
<i>That I'm mighty proud of you</i>

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,912
<i>Little wooden feet</i>
<i>and best of all</i>

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,032
<i>Little wooden seat</i>
<i>in case you fall</i>

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,913
Oh-ho! How graceful!

92
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,635
<i>My little Woodenhead</i>

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,517
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.

94
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,437
Say, "How do you do?"

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,117
Say hello to Figaro.

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,918
Oops! Oh-ho-ho!
Up to mischief already.

97
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,117
You see what happens?

98
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,437
Boo!

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,195
Up we go! Ahh.

100
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,834
You're a cute little fellow.

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,997
And that smile?
You know, I--

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,513
You rascal.Jealous, huh?

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,078
You know, Pinocchio, I think
Figaro is jealous of you.

104
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,435
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.

105
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,109
I sti-- Uh-oh.

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
I wonder what time it is.

107
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,434
It's getting late.

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,560
Come, now. We go to bed.

109
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
Good night, Pinocchio.

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,431
Little funny face.

111
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,519
Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.

112
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,756
Figaro.

113
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,599
You say good night too.

114
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,317
Go on.

115
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,992
Now go to sleep,
my little mermaid.

116
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,917
Good night.

117
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,835
This is my idea of comfort.

118
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,157
Solid comfort.

119
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,912
Look at him, Figaro.

120
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,832
He almost looks alive.

121
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,515
Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?

122
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,676
Oh, well.

123
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,349
Come on. We go to sleep.

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,269
Ah, Figaro.

125
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,198
I forgot to open the window.

126
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,193
Oh, Figaro! Look, look!
The wishing star!

127
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,757
Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight;

128
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,270
I wish I may, I wish I might...

129
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,595
have the wish I make tonight.

130
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,712
Figaro, you know what
I wish?

131
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,396
I wish that
my little Pinocchio...

132
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,229
might be a real boy.

133
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,794
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!

134
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,593
A real boy!

135
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,759
A very lovely thought.
But not at all practical.

136
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,917
A real...

137
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,877
boy.

138
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,830
Quiet!

139
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,309
After all, enough's enough.

140
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,671
Now what's up?

141
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,310
Hey, what's going on here?

142
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,755
As I live and breathe, a fairy!

143
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,711
Mm-mmm.

144
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,074
Good Geppetto, you have given
so much happiness to others.

145
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,919
You deserve to have
your wish come true.

146
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,755
Little puppet made of pine,

147
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,235
wake.

148
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,635
The gift of life is thine.

149
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,077
Whew! What they can't do
these days!

150
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,431
I can move!

151
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,995
I can talk!

152
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,917
I can walk!

153
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,749
- Yes, Pinocchio,
I've given you life.
- Why?

154
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,475
Because tonight, Geppetto
wished for a real boy.

155
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,717
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.

156
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,719
To make Geppetto's wish come
true will be entirely up to you.

157
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,960
- Up to me?
- Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish,

158
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,073
- and someday you
will be a real boy.
- A real boy!

159
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,838
That won't be easy.

160
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,235
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.

161
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,432
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?

162
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,154
- How will he know.
- Your conscience will tell you.

163
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,317
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!

164
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,237
I'll tell ya!

165
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,114
A conscience is that
still small voice that
people won't listen to.

166
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,949
- That's just the trouble
with the world today, you see?
- Are you my conscience?

167
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,877
Who, me?

168
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,549
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

169
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,433
Well, w-- uh, I--

170
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,518
I-- uh-- Ohh. Uh-huh.

171
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,074
Very well. What is your name?

172
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,909
Uh, oh, uh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.

173
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,430
- Kneel, Mr Cricket.
- Huh?

174
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,357
No tricks now.

175
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,311
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience,

176
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,512
lord high keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,

177
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,074
counsellor in moments
of temptation...

178
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,033
and guide along the straight
and narrow path.

179
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,355
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

180
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,268
Well! Oh-ho-ho!
My, my!

181
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,109
Mmm. Say, that's pretty swell.

182
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,993
Gee... thanks.

183
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,509
But, uh, don't I get
a badge or something?

184
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,359
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean maybe I will?

185
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,755
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?

186
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,518
Maybe.

187
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,438
Now, remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

188
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,155
And always let your conscience
be your guide.

189
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,552
Goodbye, milady.

190
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,591
Goodbye!

191
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,475
Not bad, says I.

192
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,990
Oh, yeah. Ho-ho-ho.
Almost forgot about you.

193
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,554
Well, Pinoke.

194
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,798
-Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.
-Why?

195
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,151
- Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh!

196
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,158
All right. Sit down, son.

197
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,512
- Now, you see, the world
is full of temptations.
- Temptations?

198
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,312
Yep. Temptations.

199
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,954
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time.

200
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,278
But, uh, even though the right
things may seem wrong sometimes,

201
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,155
uh, sometimes the,
the wrong things may be
right at the wrong time.

202
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,635
Or, uh, visa versa.

203
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,510
- Understand?
- Uh-uh.

204
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,517
But I'm gonna do right!

205
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,189
Atta boy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.

206
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,073
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle...

207
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,316
like this.

208
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,510
Like this?

209
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,392
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.

210
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,351
Like this?

211
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,756
No, son. Now, listen.

212
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,434
That's it! Come on, now,
let's sing it!

213
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,950
<i>When you get in trouble and</i>
<i>you don't know right from wrong</i>

214
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,991
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

215
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,350
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

216
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,268
<i>When you meet temptation</i>
<i>and the urge is very strong</i>

217
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,436
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

218
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,074
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

219
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,478
<i>Not just a little squeak</i>
<i>Pucker up and blow</i>

220
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,070
<i>-And if your whistle's</i>
<i>weak, yell</i>
-Jiminy Cricket?

221
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,239
Right!
<i>Take the straight and narrow</i>
<i>path and if you start to slide</i>

222
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,998
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

223
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,236
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

224
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,670
<i>And always let your</i>
<i>conscience be your guide</i>

225
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,390
<i>Take the straight and narrow</i>
<i>path and if you start to slide</i>

226
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,397
<i>Give a little whistle</i>
Yoo-hoo!

227
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,875
<i>Give a little whistle</i>
Whoo-hoo!

228
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,437
<i>And always let your</i>
<i>conscience be your guide</i>

229
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,393
<i>And always let your</i>
<i>conscience be your guide</i>

230
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,715
Look out, Pinoke!

231
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,073
- Who is there?
- It's me!

232
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,509
Oh, it's me.

233
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,271
Shh, Figaro.

234
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,039
There's somebody in here.

235
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,477
Shh!

236
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,477
Be careful now, Figaro.

237
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,751
He might spring out
on us at any time.

238
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,999
He's in here somewhere.

239
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,917
Here I am!

240
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,590
Oh... Pinocchio.

241
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,473
How did you get down here?

242
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,353
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.

243
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,836
- Ohh! You're talking!
- Uh-huh.

244
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,428
- N-N-N-No!
- Yes, and I can move too!

245
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,838
No, n-no, you, you can't--
I-I'm dreaming in my sleep.

246
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,155
W-W-Wake me up. Wake me up!

247
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,352
Now we see who is dreaming.

248
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,190
Go on. Say something.

249
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,275
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!

250
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,710
- You do talk!
- Yes, the Blue Fairy came--

251
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,717
- The Blue Fairy?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,956
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience!

253
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,514
And someday I'm gonna
be a real boy!

254
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,189
A real boy! It is my wish.
It's come true!

255
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,836
Figaro, look!
He-- He's alive. He can talk!

256
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,032
- Let's say hello to Figaro.
- Hello to Figaro.

257
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,756
Ohh. Oh, Cleo, I almost forgot.

258
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,758
Look! It's Pinocchio!

259
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,873
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,638
Yeah, cute.

261
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,953
This calls for a celebration.

262
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,877
Music!

263
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,237
You start one, Pinocchio.

264
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,070
Oh, boy. A party!

265
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,997
Mind if I cut in?

266
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,551
How about sitting out
the next one, babe, huh?

267
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,389
Whoop! Hey, whoa, let me out!
Let me out!

268
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,717
Come, Cleo, join the party.
Dance!

269
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,319
Ooh, nice.

270
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,317
<i>Gathering toys</i>

271
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,595
<i>For my little boy</i>

272
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,032
- Look! Pretty!
- Oh!

273
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,593
Help!

274
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,199
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where's the bucket?

275
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,392
Help! Water! Where's the water?

276
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,034
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water! Here's some water!

277
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,039
Help! Where's water?

278
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,078
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed...

279
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,794
before something else happens.

280
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,913
Little man, you've had
a busy night.

281
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,916
Now, close your eyes
and go to sleep.

282
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,837
Why?

283
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,669
Oh, everybody has to sleep.

284
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,191
Figaro goes to sleep...
and Cleo...

285
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,791
and, and besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.

286
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,036
Why?

287
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,199
Oh, to learn things and--

288
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,880
and get smart.

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,831
Why?

290
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,630
- Because.
- Oh.

291
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,435
- Oh, look, Father! Look!
- Now, wait. Stand still now.

292
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,677
- What are those?
- Huh? Oh, those.

293
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,429
They are your schoolmates.
Girls and boys.
Uh, no-now, get in--

294
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,357
- Real boys?
- Yes.

295
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,075
But hurry now.
Oh, oh, wai-wai-wait! Wait. Eh--

296
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,113
Here's an apple for your
teacher. Now turn around...

297
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,118
and let me look you over.

298
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,316
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.

299
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,035
Here. Run along now.

300
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,198
Fig, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.

301
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,590
School is not for you.

302
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,589
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, son. Hurry back.

303
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,554
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...

304
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,070
of little innocent children
wending their way to school.

305
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,510
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.

306
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,917
School, a noble institution.

307
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,032
What would this stupid
world be without--

308
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,070
Well, well, well!

309
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,955
Stromboli! So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?

310
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,748
Remember, Gideon, the time
I tied strings on you...

311
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,555
and passed you off
as a puppet?

312
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,389
We nearly put one over on
that old gypsy that time.

313
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,155
A little wooden boy.

314
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,714
Now, who'd have-- A wooden boy!

315
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,748
Look, Giddy, look! It's amazing.

316
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,236
A live puppet without strings.

317
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,033
A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.

318
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,913
Now let me see.

319
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,837
That's it! Stromboli!

320
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,794
Why, that fat old faker
would give his-- Listen.

321
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,629
If we play our cards right,
we'll be on Easy Street,

322
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,957
or my name isn't Honest John.

323
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,389
Quick, we'll head him off.

324
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,708
Shh! Now's our--

325
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,709
No, no, stupid.

326
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,035
Don't be crude.

327
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,357
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.

328
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,758
Ah, yes, Skinny, as I was saying
to the Duchess only yesterday--

329
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,956
Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me.

330
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,594
Oh, my, my, my, my.

331
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,109
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

332
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,879
Oh, I do hope
you're not injured.

333
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,912
- I'm all right.
- Oh, splendid.

334
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,597
Well, well, hmm.

335
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,915
Quite a scholar, I see.

336
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,998
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.

337
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,395
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.

338
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,476
School. Ah, yes.

339
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,275
Then you haven't heard of
the easy road to success.

340
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,197
- Uh-uh.
- No?

341
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,517
I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theatre.

342
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,393
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music,

343
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,273
applause, fame!

344
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,356
- Fame?
- Yes!

345
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,155
And with that personality,
that profile, that physique,

346
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,795
why, he's a natural born
actor, eh, Giddy?

347
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,036
- But I'm going--
- Straight to the top.

348
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,948
Why, I can see your name
in lights, lights six feet high.

349
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,389
- Uh-- What <i>is</i> your name?
- Pinocchio.

350
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,990
Pinocchio! P-I-N-- Eh, uh--

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,192
U-O-- Eh, P-I-- Eh--

352
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,197
We're wasting precious time.

353
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,470
Come, on to the theatre.

354
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,910
<i>Hi diddle dee dee</i>
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

356
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,991
<i>A watch of gold</i>

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,556
<i>Hi diddle dee day</i>
<i>An actor's life is gay</i>

362
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,313
Late the first day. Oh, well,
he can't get in much trouble...

363
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,590
between here and school.

364
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,311
- Oh, boy, a parade!

00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,717

- Hey, Pinoke.

375
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,948
- <i>And lots of peanuts</i>
<i>and soda pop, Hi--</i>
- Hey!

376
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,548
- What was that?
- Oh, it's Jiminy!

377
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,591
- Whatcha doin' up there?
- Huh? Who?

378
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,678
Wha-Wha-Wha-What? Wha--
Who? Jiminy? Up where?

379
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,597
Shh!

380
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,234
Why, my boy, huh, you
must be seeing things.

381
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,510
Oh, no, that's
my conscience. He--

382
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,871
Now, now, now.Just calm down.

383
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,356
Why, there's nothing
up there to be afraid of.

384
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,715
Oh!

385
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,237
Psst! Pinoke!

386
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,557
Psst! Pinoke! Over here.

387
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,795
- Over here.
- Oh,Jiminy!

388
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,435
- I'm going to be an actor.
- All right, son,
take it easy now.

389
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,551
Remember what I said
about temptation?

390
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,353
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's him.

391
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,916
Oh, no,Jiminy,
that's Mr Honest John.

392
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,634
Honest John?

393
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,599
Get this thing off.
Get me outta here!

394
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,555
Get me out of here!

395
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,710
Oh!

396
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,715
All right then, here's
what we'll tell 'em:

397
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,877
You can't go to the theatre,
say "Thank you just the same,"

398
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,958
you're sorry but you've
got to go to school.

399
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,072
- Mm-hmm.
- Pinocchio!

400
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,829
Oh, Pinocchio! Whoo-hoo!

401
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,428
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.

402
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,758
Whoo-hoo! Oh, little boy!
Ah, there you are!

403
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,032
Now, where were we? Ah,
yes, on to the theatre!

404
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,355
Goodbye,Jiminy! Goodbye!

405
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,677
- <i>Hi diddle dee dee</i>
<i>An actor's life for me</i>
- Goodbye? Huh? Goodbye?

406
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,916
- Hey, Pinoke, you can't--
- <i>A high silk hat</i>
<i>and a silver cane</i>

407
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,837
- <i>A watch of gold</i>
<i>with a diamond chain</i>
- There he goes.

408
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,791
- Oh, what'll I do? I'll
run and tell his father.
- <i>Hi diddle dee day</i>

409
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,753
- <i>An actor's life is gay</i>
- No, that'd be snitching.

410
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,189
I'll go after him myself.

411
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,278
Ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,358
to conclude the performance
of this great show,

413
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,508
Stromboli the Master Showman--
that's a-me--

414
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,837
and by special permission
of the management--

415
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,793
that's a-me too--

416
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,956
is presenting to you
something...

417
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,277
you will absolutely
refuse to believe.

418
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,916
Well, looks like a sell-out.

419
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,237
Introducing
the only marionette...

420
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,510
who can sing and dance...

421
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,713
absolutely without
the aids of strings.

422
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,348
I hope so.

423
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,996
The one and only Pinocchio!

424
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,553
Hmph! What a build-up.

425
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,637
<i>I got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me dow--</i>

426
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,120
Go ahead, make a fool
of yourself.

427
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,276
Then maybe you'll listen
to your conscience.

428
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,435
Cute kid.

429
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,829
<i>I got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me down</i>

430
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,428
<i>To make me fret</i>
<i>or make me frown</i>

431
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,949
<i>I had strings</i>
<i>but now I'm free</i>

432
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,640
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

433
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,149
<i>Heigh-ho the merry-o</i>

434
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,794
<i>That's the only way to be</i>

435
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,309
<i>I want the world to know</i>

436
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,829
<i>Nothing ever worries me</i>

437
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,916
<i>I got no strings</i>
<i>so I can have fun</i>

438
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,873
- What I told you, huh?
- <i>I'm not tied up with anyone</i>

439
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,389
<i>They got strings</i>
<i>but you can see</i>

440
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,080
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

441
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,594
<i>You have no strings</i>
<i>Your arms is free</i>

442
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,234
<i>To love me by the Zuider Zee</i>

443
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,396
<i>Ja, ja, ja</i>
<i>If you would woo</i>

444
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,397
<i>I'd bust my strings for you</i>

445
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,796
<i>You got no strings</i>
<i>Comme ci, comme ca</i>

446
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,115
<i>Your savoir faire</i>
<i>is ooo-la-la</i>

447
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,037
<i>I've got strings</i>
<i>but entre nous</i>

448
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,276
<i>I'd cut my strings for you</i>

449
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,075
<i>Down where the Volga flows</i>

450
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,156
<i>There's a Russian rendezvous</i>

451
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,316
<i>Where me and Ivan go</i>

452
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,432
<i>But I'd rather go with you, hey</i>

453
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,914
Hey!

454
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,759
Hey!

455
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,677
Hey!

456
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,876
Hey!

457
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,238
Hey!

458
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,430
Hey!

459
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,111
- Hey!
- Hey!

460
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,074
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

461
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,675
Hmm, they like him.

462
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,597
He's a success.

463
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,553
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.

464
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,751
Well, guess he won't
need me any more.

465
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,678
What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?

466
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,953
What could have happened to him?

467
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,599
Where could he be at this hour?

468
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,118
I'd better go out again
and look for him.

469
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,352
And remember, nobody eats
a bite until I find him.

470
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,233
<i>I got-a no strings</i>
<i>but I got-a the brain</i>

471
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,953
<i>I buy a new suit</i>
<i>and I swing-a the chain</i>

472
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,913
<i>I eat-a the best</i>
<i>and I drink-a champagne</i>

473
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,270
<i>I got-a no strings on me</i>

474
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,358
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They like me.

475
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,357
Hmm, two hundred.

476
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,597
- You are sensational!
- Ya mean I'm good?

477
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,712
Ahh, three hundred.

478
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,434
You are colossal!

479
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,597
Does that mean I'm an actor?

480
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,599
Sure. I will push you
in the public's eye.

481
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,554
Your face, she will be
on everybody's tongue.

482
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,433
- Will she?
- Ye-- Uh, huh?

483
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,028
What's this?

484
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,318
Ahhh!

485
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,592
For you, my little Pinocchio.

486
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,870
For me? Gee, thanks!

487
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,992
I'll run right home
and tell my father.

488
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,869
Home?

489
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,673
Oh, sure. Going home
to your father.

490
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,030
Oh, that is very comical!

491
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,869
- Ya mean it's funny?
- Oh, sure! Yes.

492
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,117
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning.

493
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,316
Going home.

494
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,356
There, this will be your home,

495
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,869
where I can find you always.

496
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,072
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

497
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,715
To me you are belonging.

498
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,751
We will tour the world.

499
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,155
Paris. London.

500
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,592
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."

501
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,598
- No, no!
- Yes!

502
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,950
We start tonight!

503
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,835
Hmm.

504
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,272
You will make lots of money...

505
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,038
for me!

506
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,358
And when you are
growing too old,

507
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,519
you will make good... firewood!

508
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,557
Let me outta here! I gotta
get out! You can't keep me!

509
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,875
Quiet! Shut-a up...

510
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,072
before I knock-a you silly!

511
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,436
Good night,

512
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,751
my little wooden gold mine.

513
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,513
No! No, wait! Let me out!

514
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,438
I'll tell my father!

515
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,552
Giddyap! Get along there.

516
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,153
Jiminy! Oh,Jiminy!

517
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,596
Oh,Jiminy, where are ya?

518
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,390
Jiminy Cricket!

519
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,874
Well, there he goes,
sitting in the lap of luxury,

520
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,036
the world at his feet.

521
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,436
Oh, well, I can always
say I knew him when.

522
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,752
I'll just go out
of his life quietly.

523
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,553
I would like to
wish him luck though.

524
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,955
Sure! Why not?

525
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,269
Pinocchio.

526
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,235
Pinocchio. It's me, your
old friend Jiminy, remember?

527
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,397
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!

528
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,080
Pinocchio! What's happened?

529
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,949
- What did he do to ya?
- Oh, he was mad.

530
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,514
He said he was gonna push
my face in everybody's eye.

531
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,790
- Yeah?
- A-A-And just 'cause
I'm a gold brick,

532
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,195
he-he's gonna chop me
into firewood!

533
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,676
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.

534
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,917
I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.

535
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,477
Why, this is-- eh, just as
easy as... rollin' off a--

536
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,989
Kind of rusty.

537
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,791
- Needs a little oil!
- Needs a little oil, needs
a little oil, a little oil.

538
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,480
That's what I said.

539
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,074
Must be one of the old models.

540
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,156
You mean, you can't open it?

541
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,953
Yeah.

542
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,389
Looks pretty hopeless.

543
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,795
It'll take a miracle
to get us out of here.

544
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,036
Gee.

545
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,116
Pinocchio!

546
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,396
Pinocchio!

547
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,516
Giddyap!

548
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,236
Pinocch--

549
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,273
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.

550
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,789
I should've listened
to you,Jiminy.

551
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,913
No, it was my fault. I shouldn't
have walked out on you.

552
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,112
Guess I'll never see
my father again.

553
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,115
Oh, buck up, son.

554
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,392
It could be worse.
Be cheerful, like me.

555
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,355
Aw, take it easy, son.

556
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,869
Come on, blow.

557
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,555
Thatta boy.

558
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,198
Oh, well, it stopped
raining anyway.

559
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,197
Hey, that star again!
Uh, the lady, the-- Ooh!

560
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,993
- The fairy!
- What'll she say?

561
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,234
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.

562
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,154
- Why, Pinocchio.
- Uh, eh, hello!

563
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,077
Sir Jiminy!

564
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,113
Well! Uh, this is a--
a pleasant surprise. Ha-ha.

565
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,959
Pinocchio, why didn't
you go to school?

566
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,835
- School? Well, I-- um--
- Uh-- Go ahead, tell her.

567
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,713
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.

568
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,515
- Met somebody?
- Yeah. Uh, two big monsters...

569
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,915
with big green eyes!

570
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,400
- Why, I-- I--
- Monsters?

571
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,195
- Weren't you afraid?
- No, ma'am. But they
tied me in a big sack.

572
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,630
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?

573
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,320
Eh, huh? Oh,Jiminy?

574
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,476
Hey, psst! Leave me outta this.

575
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,955
They put him in a little sack.

576
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,958
- No!
- Yeah!

577
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,514
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.

578
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,234
They chopped me into firewood.

579
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,517
Oh! Oh, look!

580
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,234
My nose! What's happened?

581
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,510
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.

582
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,599
- "Perhaps"?
- Oh, but I have,
every single word.

583
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,591
Oh, please help me!
I'm awful sorry.

584
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,508
You see, Pinocchio, a lie
keeps growing and growing...

585
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,756
until it's as plain as
the nose on your face.

586
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,030
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.

587
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,038
I'll never lie again.
Honest, I won't.

588
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,391
Please, Your Honor--
Uh, uh, I mean, Miss Fairy.

589
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,875
Give him another chance,
for my sake.

590
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,594
Will ya, huh?

591
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,473
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember,

592
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,991
a boy who won't be good might
just as well be made of wood.

593
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,315
- We'll be good, won't we?
- We'll be good, won't we?

594
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,876
Very well. But this is
the last time I can help you.

595
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,034
Gee, look,Jiminy, my nose!

596
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,958
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke!

597
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,958
<i>I buy a new suit</i>
<i>and I swing-a the cane</i>

598
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,913
<i>I eat-a the fish</i>
<i>and I drink-a champagne</i>

599
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,429
<i>I got no strings on me</i>

600
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,630
- Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr Strombo--

601
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,673
Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here
before something else happens.

602
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,749
<i>Hi diddle dee dee</i>
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

603
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,791
<i>A high silk hat</i>
<i>and a silver cane</i>

604
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,876
<i>A watch of gold</i>
<i>with a diamond chain</i>

605
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,390
<i>Hi diddle dee day</i>
<i>An actor's life is gay</i>

606
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,476
<i>It's great to be a celebrity</i>

607
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,717
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

608
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,071
And the dummy fell for it...

609
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,509
hook, line and sinker!

610
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,197
And he still thinks
we're his friends.

611
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,029
And did Stromboli pay...

612
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,628
plenty!

613
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,515
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop,

614
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,949
eh, Giddy?

615
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,229
Now, uh, coachman,

616
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,037
what's your proposition?

617
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,232
Well,

618
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,875
how would you blokes like
to make some real money?

619
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,517
Well! And who do we
have to, eh--

620
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,669
No, no! Nothing like that.

621
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,678
You see--

622
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,510
I'm collecting
stupid little boys.

623
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,200
- Stupid little boys?
- You know,

624
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,312
the disobedient ones what
play hookey from school.

625
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,238
- Oh!
- And you see...

626
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,389
Yes.

627
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,795
Oh!

628
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,828
And I takes 'em
to Pleasure Island!

629
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,633
Ah, Pleasure Island.

630
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,513
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they--

631
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,950
No, no. There is no risk.

632
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,231
They never come back...

633
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,749
as boys!

634
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,510
Now, I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

635
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,791
We'll meet at the crossroads,
and no double-crossing!

636
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,592
- No, sir.
- Scout around,

637
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,359
and any good prospects
you find, bring 'em to me.

638
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,833
- Yes, Chief.
- I'll pay you well.

639
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,076
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.

640
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,514
No, sir, nothing can stop me
now. I'll make good this time.

641
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,279
- You'd better.
- I will. I'm going to school.

642
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,109
- That's the stuff, Pinoke.
- I'd rather be smart
than be an actor.

643
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,313
Now you're talkin'! Come on,
slowpoke, I'll race ya home.

644
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,909
Well, well, Pinocchio.
What's your rush?

645
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,793
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.

646
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,354
Well, how is the great actor?

647
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,631
I don't wanna be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.

648
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,479
- He was?
- Yeah, he locked me
in a bird cage--

649
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,353
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I
learned my lesson.

650
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,314
- I'm going--
- Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.

651
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,830
That's it, you are
a nervous wreck!

652
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,474
We must diagnose
this case at once.

653
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,875
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.

654
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,988
Bless my soul.

655
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,793
Hmmm, mm-hmm.

656
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,435
My, my.Just as I thought.

657
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,198
A slight touch of
monetary complications...

658
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,312
with bucolic
semi-lunar contraptions
of the flying trapezes.

659
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,558
Mm-hmm. Say "hippopotamus."

660
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,319
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!

661
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,476
Compound transmission of the
pandemonium with percussion...

662
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,512
and spasmodic
frantic disintegration.

663
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,835
- Close your eyes.
What do you see?
- Nothing.

664
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,394
-Open them. Now what do you see?
-Spots.

665
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,035
Aha! Now that heart.

666
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,755
Ooh, my goodness!

667
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,269
A palpitating syncopation
of the killer diller...

668
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,153
with the wicky wacky
stomping of the floy joy.

669
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,430
Quick, Doctor, that report.

670
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,916
Ooh, this makes it
perfectly clear!

671
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,438
My boy, you are allergic.

672
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,597
- Allergic?
- Yes, and there is
only one cure.

673
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,679
- A vacation on Pleasure Island!
- Pleasure Island?

674
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,189
Yes, that happy land
of carefree boys...

675
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,436
where every day is a holiday!

676
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,269
- But I can't go. I--
- Why, of course you can go.

677
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,914
I'm giving you my ticket.

678
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,468
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm--

679
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,673
Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.

680
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,156
Come, the coach
departs at midnight.

681
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,875
<i>Hi diddle dee dee</i>
<i>It's Pleasure Isle for me</i>

682
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,797
<i>Where every day is a holiday</i>

683
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,876
<i>And kids have nothing</i>
<i>to do but play</i>

684
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,831
- Pinoke!
- <i>Hi diddle dee dee</i>

685
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,635
Oh, Pinoke? Now where
do you suppose he-- Huh?

686
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,558
Pinocchio! Hey! Come back!

687
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,317
Giddyap!

688
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,153
Well,

689
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,999
here we go again.

690
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,793
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?

691
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,876
Pinocchio.

692
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,117
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
- Uh-uh, but Mr Honest John
gave me--

693
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,153
Me neither, but they say it's a
swell joint. No school, no cops.

694
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,352
You can tear the joint apart,
and nobody says a word.

695
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,678
- Honest John gave me--
- Loaf around, plenty to eat,
plenty to drink.

696
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,870
- And it's all free!
- Honest John--

697
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,709
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!

698
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,677
Right here, boys!
Right here!

699
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,553
Get your cake, pie,
dill pickles and ice cream.

700
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,752
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.

701
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,759
It's all free, boys.
It's all free. Hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry!

702
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,677
The Rough House.
The Rough House.

703
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,633
It's the roughest, toughest
joint ya ever seen.

704
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,309
-Come in and pick a fight, boys.
-Oh, boy, a scrap!

705
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,476
Come on, let's go in and
poke somebody in the nose.

706
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,830
- Why?
- Ah, just for the fun of it.

707
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,155
Okay, Lampy.

708
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,392
Tobacco Road. Tobacco Road.

709
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,954
Get your cigars, cigarettes
and chewin' tobacco.

710
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,038
Come in and smoke
your heads off. There's
nobody here to stop you.

711
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,151
Pinocchio!

712
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,716
Pinocchio! There's somethin'...
phoney about all this.

713
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,717
I gotta get him outta here.

714
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,149
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry! See the model home.

715
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,477
It's open for destruction,
and it's all yours, boys!

716
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,909
It's all yours!

717
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,154
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?

718
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,272
Yeah! Bein' bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

719
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,472
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load of
that stained-glass window.

720
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,710
All right now,
hop to it, you blokes.

721
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,071
Come on, come on! Shut the doors
and lock 'em tight.

722
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,519
Now get below and get
them crates ready.

723
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,758
Give a bad boy enough rope
and he'll soon make
a jackass of himself.

724
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,232
Pinocchio!

725
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,555
Pinocchio?

726
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,510
Where is everybody?

727
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,514
The place is like a graveyard.

728
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,074
I don't like the looks of this.

729
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,475
Pinocchio!

730
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,155
Hey, where are you?

731
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,514
Where d'you suppose all
the kids went to, Lampwick?

732
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,712
Ah, they're around here
somewheres. What do you care?

733
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,393
- You're having
a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.

734
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,637
Oh, boy! This is the life,
huh, Pinoky?

735
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,069
Yeah!

736
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,395
It sure is!

737
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,795
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother!

738
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,589
Come on, take
a big drag like this.

739
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,309
Okay, Lampy.

740
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,479
Some fun, huh, kid?

741
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,239
Okay, Slats, your shot.

742
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,271
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?

743
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,468
Pinocchio! So this is
where I find you.

744
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,160
How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?

745
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,794
Look at yourself. Smoking,

746
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,515
playing pool! Ow! You are coming
right home with me this minute!

747
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,200
Hey! Who's the beetle?

748
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,278
Let go! Put me down!
Let me out of here. Let me out!

749
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,437
He's my conscience. He tells me
what's right and wrong.

750
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,838
What? You mean to tell me you
take orders from a grasshopper?

751
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,077
Grasshopper? Look here,
you, you impudent young pup!

752
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,236
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshopp--

753
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,476
Uh, uh... your conscience,
if you have one.

754
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

755
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,279
Why-- Why-- Ya young hoodlum!

756
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,517
I'll-- I'll knock
your block off!

757
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,237
Why, I'll take you apart
and put you back together.

758
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,874
Oh, don't hurt him,Jiminy.
He's my best friend.

759
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,197
Why, I'll-- Your best friend?

760
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,198
And what am I?
Just your conscience.

761
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,870
Okay, that settles it.

762
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,356
- B-But,Jiminy--
- You buttered your bread,
now sleep in it.

763
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,550
Ha-ha-ha! Go on, laugh.

764
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,434
Make a jackass out of yourself.
I'm through! This is the end.

765
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,950
But,Jiminy, Lampwick says
a guy only lives once.

766
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,832
Lampwick. Hmph!

767
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,793
Come on, come on. Let him go.

768
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,315
Lampwick. Hmph, Lampwick!

769
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,399
Burns me up. After all
I tried to do for him.

770
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,911
Who's his conscience anyway? Me
or that, that hoodlum Lampwick?

771
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,759
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat
out of here.

772
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,916
Open up that door! Open up!

773
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,315
I wanna go home!

774
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,917
Come on, you blokes!
Keep 'em moving!

775
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,794
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

776
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,228
Where'd all the
donkeys come from?

777
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,749
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.

778
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,750
And what's your name?

779
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,316
Okay, you'll do! In you go!

780
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,830
You boys'll bring a nice price.

781
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,394
All right, next!

782
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,069
- And what might your name be?
- Alexander.

783
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,714
Hmm, so you can talk.

784
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,197
Ye-Yes, sir. I wanna
go home to my mama!

785
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,914
Take him back!
He can still talk!

786
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,869
Please, please! I don't
wanna be a donkey!

787
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,355
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

788
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,439
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it.

789
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,917
"Boys"? So that's what--
Pinocchio!

790
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,596
Ha! To hear that beetle talk,

791
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,838
you'd think somethin'
was going to happen to us.

792
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,749
Conscience. Nah, phooey!

793
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,876
Where does he get that stuff?

794
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,151
"How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?"

795
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,716
What's he think
I look like, a jackass?

796
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,195
You sure do!

797
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,154
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

798
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,474
Did that come out of me?

799
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,631
Oh!

800
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,910
Huh?

801
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,316
What the-- What's goin' on?

802
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,073
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!

803
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,556
Somebody, help!
I've been framed! Help!

804
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,831
Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, be a pal.

805
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,349
Call that beetle! Call anybody!

806
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,518
Mama! Mama!

807
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,069
- Oh, what's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.

808
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,754
What'll I do?

809
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,956
- Pinocchio!
-Jiminy! Oh,Jiminy, help!

810
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,072
Wait, Pinoke! The kids,
the boys, they're all donkeys!

811
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,395
Oh, you too!

812
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,909
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

813
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,314
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.

814
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,232
Hurry up... before they see us.

815
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,509
You gotta jump!

816
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,798
Jiminy.

817
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,799
Jiminy, y-you all right?

818
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,878
Sure. I thought
we'd never make it.

819
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,433
Certainly feels good
to be back on...

820
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,154
dry land.

821
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,714
Come on, let's get home.

822
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,836
Father! Father, I'm home!

823
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,475
- We're home, Mr Geppetto!
Home again!
- It's me, Pinocchio!

824
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,037
- I'm home to stay!
- Here he is, Mr Geppetto.
Home at last.

825
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,232
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

826
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,475
Father! Father, it's me!

827
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,237
Pinoke, come here.

828
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,238
Look. He ain't here.

829
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,272
He-- He's gone.

830
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,516
Yeah, and Figaro.

831
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,870
And Cleo too.

832
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,834
Maybe something awful
happened to him.

833
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,316
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

834
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,149
Hey.

835
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,077
- It's a message.
- What's it say?

836
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,509
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?

837
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,631
Why, uh, uh,
it says here he, uh,

838
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,991
he went looking for you and, uh,
uh, he was swallowed by a whale.

839
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,830
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh. A-- A whale?

840
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,235
- A whale named Monstro.
- Oh, he's--

841
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,351
Uh, but, but wait. He's alive.

842
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,152
- Alive? Where?
- Why, uh, uh,

843
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,840
inside the whale at the,
at the bottom of the sea.

844
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,396
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh. Uh-- Hey!
Where you going?

845
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,636
I'm going to find him.

846
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,716
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?

847
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,070
Don't you realize,
uh, he's in a whale?

848
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,316
I've gotta go to him.

849
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,635
Hey, Pinoke, wait!

850
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,876
Listen here, son.

851
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,871
But this Monstro,
I've heard of him.

852
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,797
He's a whale of a whale.

853
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,434
Why, he swallows
whole ships alive.

854
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,757
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.

855
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,711
- Why, I--
- Bye,Jiminy.

856
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,515
Goodbye? I may be live bait
down there, but I'm with ya.

857
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,757
Come on, let's go.

858
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,316
Look out below!

859
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,112
Gangway, down there.

860
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,029
Gee, what a big place.

861
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,554
- Come on,Jiminy.
- All right.

862
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,194
Soon as I take on some ballast.

863
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,629
One side, sister.

864
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,395
Well, so long.

865
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,234
Hmm, put it in the wrong end.

866
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,514
Hmph, no more privacy
than a goldfish.

867
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,915
Ooh, chilly.

868
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,076
Father!

869
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,910
Father!

870
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,916
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

871
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,110
Father!

872
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,119
Father! Huh, he ain't my father.

873
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,800
Uh, Mr Geppetto!

874
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,634
Hey, what the--

875
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,830
Hey, le-- let go!

876
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,679
Run along, ya little... squirt.

877
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,553
What's the matter? Can't
a fellow, uh-- I was only--

878
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,474
We were only looking
for Monstro.

879
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,554
That got 'em.

880
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,796
Father!

881
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,435
Father!

882
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,516
Oh, hello.

883
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,670
Oh! Uh...

884
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,839
can you tell me where
we can find Monstro?

885
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,396
Gee, they're scared.

886
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,835
Uh, pardon me, pearl,

887
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,393
are you acquainted
with Monstro the whale?

888
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,109
Whoa, hold it there.

889
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,879
- Hmph!
- Father!

890
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,756
One side there, son.

891
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,792
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.

892
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,596
Hey, what the--

893
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,472
Whoa, quit, quit,
quit shoving now.

894
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,036
Quit, whoa. Don't crowd.
Now take it easy.
Take it easy there.

895
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,908
Whoa-ho-ho there. Whoa!

896
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,316
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

897
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,552
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

898
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,592
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

899
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,831
Uh, sakes alive.

900
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,876
Father!

901
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,789
- Father!
- Mr Geppetto!

902
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,150
Not a bite for days.

903
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,549
We can't hold out much longer.

904
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,752
I never thought...

905
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,555
it would end this way, Figaro.

906
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,757
Starving to death...

907
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,997
in the belly of a whale.

908
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,874
My poor little Pinocchio.

909
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,629
He was such a good boy.

910
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,593
It's hopeless, Figaro.

911
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,952
There isn't a fish left.

912
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,833
If the monster doesn't
wake up soon, I--

913
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,155
I'm afraid we--

914
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,838
We are done for.

915
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,914
Here they come!

916
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,873
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

917
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,795
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one!

918
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,557
Keep them in there, Figaro!

919
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,436
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ha-Have you seen--

920
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,397
Monstro!

921
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,274
We got to get out of here!

922
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,918
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me.

923
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,031
Never saw so many!

924
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,275
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!

925
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,197
Here's a big one.

926
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,075
Keep them in there, Figaro!

927
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,716
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I got to get in there!

928
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,599
Looks like the last of them.

929
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,479
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.

930
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,909
We got to work fast!

931
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,270
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

932
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,630
Hey, Father!

933
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,638
- Father!
- Don't bother me now,
Pinocchio!

934
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,155
- P-Pinocchio!
- Father!

935
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,113
Pinocchio, my son!

936
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:24,119
- Hey, Father, here I am!
- Huh?

937
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,550
Oh, oh, yes! Pinocchio, my boy!

938
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,559
- I-- I'm so happy to see you!
- Me too, Father!

939
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,593
- Oops!
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.

940
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,473
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

941
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,068
- You're here too.
- Yes!

942
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,715
We are all together again!

943
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,593
- Oh, you, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

944
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,676
You, you mustn't catch cold.

945
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,315
- But I came to save you!
- 'Cause you know, you, you
shouldn't have come down here.

946
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,591
- But, Father!
- But I'm awfully glad
to see you.

947
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,917
Let me take your hat. Oh!

948
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,112
Pinocchio!

949
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,390
Wh-- Wh-- What's the matter?

950
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,671
- Those ears!
- Huh? Ears?

951
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,677
Oh, these.

952
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,075
Hah. Oh, that's nothing.

953
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,997
I got a tail too.

954
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,230
Pinocchio!

955
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,590
What's happened to you?

956
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,110
Well, I-- I-- I--

957
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,356
Oh, never mind now.

958
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,675
Old Geppetto has his
little Woodenhead.

959
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,189
Nothing else matters.

960
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,073
I got to get in!
My pal's in there!

961
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,350
Come on, you big moose!
Open up, I tell ya--

962
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,277
Hey! Cut it out!

963
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,358
Oh, boy. Beat it, you buzzards!

964
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,277
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.

965
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,994
Why, I, I even built a raft.

966
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,873
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?

967
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,719
We'll take the raft, and when
the whale opens its mouth--

968
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,990
No, no, no, no.
N-Now listen, son.

969
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,749
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

970
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,996
Then everything comes in.

971
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,917
Nothing goes out.

972
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,156
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

973
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,909
Come. We make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

974
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,749
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes. And then we'll
all eat again.

975
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,235
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.

976
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,157
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.

977
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,998
A smoked fish will taste good.

978
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,510
- Quick, some wood.
- Pinocchio, not the chair!

979
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,870
Hurry, Father. More wood!

980
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,991
Oh, what will we sit on if we--

981
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,192
We won't need it.
We're getting out!

982
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,390
Getting out? But how?

983
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,433
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?

984
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,599
Ohh, that will make him mad.

985
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,149
Well, it's about time!

986
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,913
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!

987
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,715
-We'll never get by those teeth!
-Yes, we will!

988
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,549
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!

989
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,399
Hang on! Here we go!

990
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,513
Gesundheit.

991
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,830
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it!
Faster, faster!

992
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,668
It's no use! We're done for!

993
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,076
We made it!

994
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,509
Look! Now he is mad!

995
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,156
I told you he'd be furious!

996
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,950
- He's gone!
- Where did he go?

997
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,640
Look out!

998
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,069
Hang on!

999
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,794
He's coming back. Hurry!

1000
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,639
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!

1001
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,199
Let's go back!

1002
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,996
Look out!Jump!

1003
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,119
Father! Father!

1004
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,595
Oh, Father!

1005
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,598
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.

1006
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,758
Hang on, Father!

1007
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,633
Save... yourself.

1008
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,316
Pinocchio,

1009
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,431
save yourself.

1010
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,391
Don't mind me, son.

1011
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,715
Save yourself, Pinocchio.

1012
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,910
Pinocchio?

1013
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,077
Oh, Pinocchio!

1014
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,997
Pinocchi--

1015
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,157
My boy.

1016
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,271
My brave little boy.

1017
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,554
Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish,

1018
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:33,878
and someday you will
be a real boy.

1019
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,514
Awake, Pinocchio.

1020
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,471
Awake.

1021
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,070
Father! Whatcha crying for?

1022
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,636
'Cause... you are dead,
Pinocchio.

1023
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,432
No! No, I'm not.

1024
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,109
Yes, yes, you are.
Now, lie down.

1025
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,515
But, Father, I'm alive. See?

1026
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,349
And-- And I'm, uh--

1027
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,917
I'm-- I'm real. I'm a real boy!

1028
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,352
You're alive! And, and
