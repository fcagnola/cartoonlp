I'm sorry. But how can one
possibly pay attention

Better look first, for if one drinks
much from a bottle marked "Poison",

Nonsense. I'm as dry as a bone already.

177
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,838
- Yes, but...
- [Dodo] All right, let's have it now.

- Don't go away. I'll be right back.

- I'm late.
- [Dodo] Don't step on the fish.

182
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:54,189
[Dodo] Watch it. Stop kicking that
mackerel. Brilliant. Jolly well done.

Mr. Rabbit. Oh, Mr. Rabbit.

184
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,906
Oh, dear. I'm sure he came this way.

185
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,701
Do you suppose he could be hiding?

186
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,414
Hmm. Not here.

187
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,625
I wonder...

188
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,762
No. I suppose he must have... [gasps]

189
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,057
Why. What peculiar little figures.

- Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

It's been nice meeting you. Goodbye.

00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,878

- That's manners.
- Really?

Well my name is Alice
and I'm following a white rabbit, so...

201
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,437
- You can't go yet.
- No, the visit has just started.

202
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,441
- I'm very sorry.
- Would you like to play hide-and-seek?

203
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,361
- Or Button? Who's got the button?
- No, thank you.

204
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,156
If you stay long enough,
we might have a battle.

205
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,284
That's very kind of you,
but I must be going.

206
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,496
- Why?
- Because I'm following a white rabbit.

207
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,584
- Why?
- I'm curious to know where he's going.

00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,753
Oh, she's curious.

209
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,923
The oysters were curious, too,
weren't they?

210
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,469
Aye, and you remember
what happened to them.

Poor things.

212
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,641
Why? What did happen to the oysters?

213
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,310
- Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
- But I am.

214
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,313
Oh, no.
You're in much too much of a hurry.

215

Well,
perhaps I could spare a little time.

Yes, yes. Splendid idea.
Very good indeed.
