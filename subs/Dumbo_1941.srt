00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,072
Through the snow
and sleet and hail...

3
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:37,423
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

4
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,676
through the wind
and through the rain...

5
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,678
over mountain, over plain...

6
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:47,098
through the blinding
lightning flash...

7
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:50,685
and the mighty thunder crash...

8
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:54,939
ever faithful, ever true...

9
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:57,317
nothing stops him.

10
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,527
He'll get through.

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,495
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
that persevering chap</i>

12
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:12,080
<i>He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap</i>

13
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:15,542
<i>You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which</i>

14
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:19,171
<i>Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker</i>

15
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>So look out for Mr Stork
and let me tell you, friend</i>

16
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:26,970
<i>Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end</i>

17
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:30,224
<i>He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork</i>

18
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:33,685
<i>So you'd better look out
for Mr Stork</i>

19
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:25,777
<i>Look out for Mr Stork
He's got you on his list</i>

20
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:29,531
<i>And when he comes around
it's useless to resist</i>

21
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:33,200
<i>Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe</i>

22
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:36,704
<i>Maybe he's got his eye on you</i>

23
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,684
All aboard! All aboard!

- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

154
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:08,669
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

155
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:10,337
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

156

00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:31,775
Down. Mrs Jumbo, down!

161
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,695
Surround her. Tie her down.

162
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,049
Get down!

Darling, it was so funny.

165
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,632
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

166
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:41,511
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

167
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:44,431
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

168
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,892
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

169
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,685
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

170
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,146
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.

171
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,607
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

172
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,693
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

173
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:59,154
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in...

174
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,281
A guy can't eat in peace.

175
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,325
Yes, but mother love does...

176
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,619
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

177
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,122
Girls, girls! Listen!

178
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,583
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

179
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,586
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

180
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,299
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

181
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,385
- No!
- You don't mean it!

182
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,929
Oh, how awful for her!

183
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,848
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.

184
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:30,686
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

185
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:33,855
F-R-E-A-K.

186
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:38,402
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

187
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,655
What's the matter with his ears?

188
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:44,825
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

189
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:49,538
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

190
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,873
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

191
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:56,503
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

192
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:58,964
His disgrace is our own shame.

193
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,008
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

194
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:05,804
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

195
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,222
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

196
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,017
- I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

197
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,477
Here he comes now.

198
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:16,273
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

199
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:18,942
Shh.

200
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:25,782
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

201
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:30,203
Poor little guy.

202
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:34,624
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

203
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:38,503
Nobody to turn to.

204
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,717
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

205
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,724
A mouse!

206
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,898
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

207
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:00,651
Well, why don't you pick on me?

208
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,451
A proud race.

209
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:11,787
Overstuffed hay bags!

210
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,509
Boo!

211
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:28,261
Still afraid of a mouse.

212
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:31,556
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

213
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,393
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

214
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:37,145
You can come out now.

215
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,649
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

216
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,943
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

217
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:44,987
Come on out, won't ya?

218
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:50,117
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

219
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:54,121
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

220
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:56,915
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

221
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,962
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

222
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:09,094
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

223
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:17,519
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

224
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:22,441
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

225
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:25,444
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

226
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:34,161
Well, that's more like it.

227
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:36,788
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

228
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:39,291
She's just broken-hearted.

229
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:43,211
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

230
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:46,590
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

231
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:51,636
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

232
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,641
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

233
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:59,686
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

234
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,023
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

235
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:06,193
Make ya a star. A headliner!

236
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:08,487
Dumbo the Great!

237
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:14,368
Uh-oh. The great what?

238
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:20,374
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

239
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:24,378
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...

240
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:28,215
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

241
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,509
Huh. He never had an idea
in his life.

242
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:34,930
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up...

243
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:38,266
on top of another elephant
until finally...

244
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,602
all 17 elephants...

245
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:44,106
have constructed
an enormous pyramid...

246
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,274
of pachyderms.

247
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,819
I step out.

248
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:50,862
I blow the whistle.

249
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:53,407
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

250
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,325
- Yeah.
- And now...

251
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:57,703
comes the climax!

252
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:01,707
Yeah? What is the climax?

253
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,251
Hmm. I don't know.

254
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,628
I knew he never had nothin'.

255
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:09,673
Well, maybe it comes to me...

256
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:13,427
in a vision while I dream.

257
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,887
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

258
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,931
Climax.

259
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:23,103
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

260
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,566
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

261
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:28,168
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

262
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:31,797
Your inspiration.

263
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,424
Now, concentrate.

264
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:39,179
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

265
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:41,390
are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

266
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:45,310
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

267
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,396
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

268
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,691
Comin' through okay? Good.

269
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:53,235
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

270
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,696
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

271
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,156
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

272
00:27:58,281 --> 00:27:59,741
to a platform.

273
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:03,078
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

274
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,871
for a glorious finish!

275
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:08,959
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

276
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:11,962
The little elephant
with the big ears!

277
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:17,467
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

278
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,469
What?

279
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:22,014
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

280
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:24,349
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

281
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:27,728
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

282
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:29,813
I got it! I got it!

283
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:34,151
Ladies and gentlemen...

284
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,654
we will now present
for your entertainment...

285
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:41,074
the most stupendous, magnificent...

286
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:44,494
super-colossal spectacle.

287
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:46,872
On this tiny...

288
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:50,042
little, insignificant ball...

289
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,336
we will construct for you...

290
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:56,340
a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

291
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:59,426
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

292
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,346
- But a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

293
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:06,433
Pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

294
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:10,937
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

295
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,316
I give you the elephants.

296
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,677
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

297
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,021
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

298
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:56,483
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

299
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,611
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

300
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,337
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

301
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,387
Steady, girls.

302
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,148
Boy, that was a close one.

303
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:39,776
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

304
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,779
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

305
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:45,532
Now, look. All ya gotta do
is run out, see?

306
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,617
Jump on the springboard.

307
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:51,538
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

308
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:54,708
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

309
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,169
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

310
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,838
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

311
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,344
Ladies and gentlemen...

312
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:08,388
you have now seen the impossible...

313
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,849
accomplished in front of your faces.

314
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,602
Seven jungle giants...

315
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,604
each one weighing not...

316
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,272
That windbag!

317
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:20,233
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

318
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,527
And now, I present...

319
00:31:22,653 --> 00:31:25,906
the world's smallest
little elephant...

320
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:29,910
who will spring
from this springboard...

321
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:32,120
in one spring...

322
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:36,208
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

323
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,586
for a grand climax!

324
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,130
Ladies and gentlemen...

325
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:45,509
I give you Dumbo!

326
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:58,647
Go on! Get goin'!

327
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,984
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

328
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,111
You're on, Dumbo.

329
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,341
Out of my way, assassin!

330
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:13,615
- Dear!
- Ohh.

331
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,953
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

332
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:22,666
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

333
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:26,128
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

334
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:29,715
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him...

335
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,760
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

336
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:38,056
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

337
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,600
They fixed him good.

338
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:42,602
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

339
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:44,396
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

340
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:47,024
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

341
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:51,278
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...

342
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:54,239
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

343
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:57,117
Made him a clown.

344
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,119
A clown?

345
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:02,039
- No!
- Yes.

346
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:05,792
Oh, the shame of it.

347
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:08,337
Let us take the solemn vow.

348
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:14,217
From now on, he is no longer...

349
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:16,219
an elephant.

350
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:29,483
Please! Help me save
my poor baby!

351
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:33,320
Whoo! Save my child!

352
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:45,666
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!

353
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:48,377
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,671
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:40,846

359
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:59,781
Whew! Boy, oh, boy,

360
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:01,783
- What a performance!
- Are we good?

361
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,618
Thirteen curtain calls.

363
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:08,874
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

364
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:10,917
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

365
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:13,211
- Boy, oh, boy, what a act.
- Oh, "what a act" is right.

366
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,963
Stupendous, I calls it.

367
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,923
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

368
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:19,092
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

369
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:21,720
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

370
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:25,015
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

371
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,017
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

372
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,437
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

373
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,190

00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:35,400
Yeah. You're a big hit.

00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:41,990
Why, uh, you're terrific.

00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:46,745
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

Cosy little place, ain't it?

00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,599
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

418
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,685
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

419
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:41,855
- Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

420
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:44,316
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

421
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:46,985
Yeah! If they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet...

422
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,946
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

423
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,033
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

424
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:56,703
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

425
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:58,747
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

426
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,583
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

427
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,627
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

428
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,588
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

429
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:09,466
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

430
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:10,968
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

431
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:12,886
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.

432
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,180
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

433
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:18,934
<i>Oh, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

434
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:22,604
<i>Yes, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

435
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:26,525
<i>Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny</i>

436
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,903
<i>We're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise</i>

437
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:39,079
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

438
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:43,166
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

439
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,003
Remember, you come of a proud race.

440
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:49,798
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

441
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,800
and pachyderms don't cry.

442
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:54,970
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

443
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,099
There. Ya see?

444
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:07,441
Well, ain't nothin'
a little water won't cure.

445
00:43:07,524 --> 00:43:10,444
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya
fixed up in a jiffy.

446
00:43:11,528 --> 00:43:13,447
Come on.

447
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,287
Here. Take a trunk full.

448
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:24,291
Listen, little fella.

449
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:27,127
We may have had a lot
of hard luck up till now...

450
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,464
but you and me is gonna do
big things together.

451
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:34,468
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

452
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,136
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

453
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,389
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

454
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:41,475
Swallow it.

455
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:44,019
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

456
00:43:46,396 --> 00:43:48,690
Oh, I guess you had
one little one left over.

457
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:52,235
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

458
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,238
Hey, what's the matter with you?

459
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:04,081
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

460
00:44:57,217 --> 00:45:00,137
Balloonies.

461
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,222
Hiya, George.

462
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:25,245
Whee!

463
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:36,048
That's a pretty
schstrick schlick.

464
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:41,261
All right. Let's see ya

465
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,605
Say, that's very, very clever.

466
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:56,276
Now blow a great big one.

00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:20,300
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

Dumbo.

469
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,726
You see what I see?

470
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,256
<i>Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade</i>

471
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,717
<i>Here they come
Hippity-hoppity</i>

472
00:47:43,842 --> 00:47:47,971
<i>They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere</i>

473
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:50,265
<i>Look out, look out</i>

474
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:53,226
<i>They're walking around the bed
on their head</i>

475
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,229
<i>Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid</i>

476
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:58,690
<i>Pink elephants on parade</i>

477
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:00,776
<i>- What'll I do
- What'll I do</i>

478
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,111
<i>What an unusual view</i>

479
00:48:03,195 --> 00:48:07,032
<i>I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs</i>

480
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:11,662
<i>But Technicolour pachyderms
is really too much for me</i>

481
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,664
<i>I am not the type to faint</i>

482
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:15,749
<i>When things are odd
or things are quaint</i>

483
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:17,918
<i>But seein'things

484
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:20,462

00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:23,590
<i>What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away</i>

486
00:48:23,674 --> 00:48:27,427
<i>I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade</i>

487
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:29,888
<i>- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants</i>

488
00:48:31,056 --> 00:48:33,183
<i>Pink elephants</i>

489
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:35,185
<i>Pink elephants</i>

490
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:04,668
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

491
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:06,670
Why, this is most irregular.

492
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:09,298
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

493
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:14,303
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

494
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:16,722
Or do they?

495
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:20,309
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

496
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:24,521
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

497
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,690
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

498
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:30,694
- Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

499
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,495
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

500
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:42,706
Yeah. Find out
what they're doin' up here.

501
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:44,916
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.

502
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,336
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

503
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:15,614
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

504
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:18,575
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

505
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:26,291
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

506
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,502
What are we doin' down here?

507
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:30,504
Well, hear him talk.

508
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:33,590
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

509
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:37,970
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

510
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:41,390
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

511
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:44,184
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

512
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:48,021
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

513
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:51,650
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no... Huh?

514
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:53,860
Tree?

515
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:58,573
Yo!

516
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:02,285
Dumbo.

517
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,955
Dumbo. Wake up.

518
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,958
Wake up, Dumbo!

519
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:11,628
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

520
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:43,535
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

521
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:46,747
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

522
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,874
So long, boy!

523
00:53:56,715 --> 00:54:00,135
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

524
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,765
Now, let's see.

525
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,434
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

526
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:10,062
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

527
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:13,273
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

528
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:15,901
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

529
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:20,906
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

530
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:24,117
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

531
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:26,745
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

532
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,207
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

533
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,962
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

534
00:54:35,045 --> 00:54:37,255
I can see it all now.

535
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:39,925
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

536
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,260
The world's only flyin' elephant!

537
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:47,307
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

538
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:50,978
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

539
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:53,188
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

540
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,067
See, I've seen all that too.

541
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,779
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

542
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:03,824
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

543
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:07,285
<i>But I be done seen

544
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,579

545
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:13,417

00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:23,635

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,887

552
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:34,604
<i>I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck</i>

553
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:37,983
<i>And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck</i>

554
00:55:38,066 --> 00:55:41,028
<i>I didn't see that
I only heard</i>

555
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,739
<i>Just to be sociable
I'll take your word</i>

556
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:47,034
<i>- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat</i>

557
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:50,037
<i>And I just laughed

558
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,790

00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:20,525
With the wind.

<i>When I see a elephant</i>

565
00:56:25,238 --> 00:56:27,783
<i>Fly</i>

566
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:38,877
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

567
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:45,092
Quiet, gentlemen.

568
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:47,844
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

569
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:51,098
You oughta be ashamed
of yourselves.

570
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,475
A bunch of big guys like you...

571
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:56,853
pickin' on a poor
little orphan like him.

572
00:56:56,937 --> 00:57:01,191
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

573
00:57:01,274 --> 00:57:03,652
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

574
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:08,657
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

575
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,076
How would you like to be
left out alone...

576
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,538
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

577
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:17,874
And why? I ask ya, why?

578
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:21,962
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

579
00:57:22,045 --> 00:57:24,172
The laughing stock of the circus.

580
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:26,800
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

581
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:29,303
they threw her into the clink.

582
00:57:29,386 --> 00:57:33,140
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

583
00:57:33,265 --> 00:57:36,184
Socially, he's washed up.

584
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:40,480
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you cold-hearted birds?

585
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:42,691
Go ahead. Have your fun.

586
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:45,861
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

587
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:48,405
Go on!

588
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:50,490
We don't care.

589
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,499
Come on, Dumbo.

590
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:07,215
Hey, brother,
w-w-wait a minute.

591
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:09,885
Uh, don't go away
feelin' like that.

592
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,220
We done seen the light.

593
00:58:12,304 --> 00:58:14,222
You boys is okay.

594
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,516
Please, you've done enough.

595
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,937
Well, but we's all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

596
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:23,231
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

597
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:26,234
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

598
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,738
Well, you gotta use a lot of'chology.
You know, psychology.

599
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:32,949
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...

600
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:34,951
Uh, bu...

601
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:37,954
And then, right after that,
you, uh...

602
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:43,210
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

603
00:58:43,293 --> 00:58:45,837
The magic feather?

604
00:58:45,963 --> 00:58:47,923
Yeah, I gotcha.

605
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:51,593
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

606
00:58:51,718 --> 00:58:54,638
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

607
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,354
Let's go. Let's go.

608
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:05,941
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

609
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:09,277
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

610
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:11,279
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

611
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:13,573
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

612
00:59:13,657 --> 00:59:15,951
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

613
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,495
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

614
00:59:18,578 --> 00:59:20,497
Take off.

615
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:29,756
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

616
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,301
I guess it's just
another one of their... Look!

617
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:35,095
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

618
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:37,139
You're flyin'!

619
00:59:39,683 --> 00:59:43,270
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

620
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:45,647
That's better than a aeroplane.

621
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:48,233
Brother, now I've seen everything.

622
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,739

Wait'll we get to the big town.

01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:47,501
you're standing
on the threshold of success.

636
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:50,045
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

Uh-oh. The magic feather!

642

Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

643
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:26,331
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.
