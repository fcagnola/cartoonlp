4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,410
{\i1}Now, where to begin?{\i0}

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,500
{\i1}How 'bout, ''Once upon a time''?{\i0}

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,130
{\i1}How many times have you{\i0}
{\i1}heard that to begin a story?{\i0}

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,880
{\i1}Let's do somethin' else-{\i0}

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,170
{\i1}I got it, I got it, here we go-{\i0}
{\i1}Here's how to open a movie!{\i0}

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,470
{\i1}No, I don't think so-{\i0}
{\i1}It sounds familiar- Doesn't it, to you?{\i0}

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,560
{\i1}Oh, no, no, not the book-{\i0}

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
{\i1}How many have seen{\i0}
{\i1}''opening the book'' before?{\i0}

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,650
{\i1}Close the book-{\i0}
{\i1}We're not doing that-{\i0}

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,650
{\i1}Here's what we're gonna do-{\i0}

14
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,320
{\i1}Here's what we're gonna do-{\i0}

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,860
{\i1}Why don't I just{\i0}
{\i1}go back to the day{\i0}

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,950
{\i1}things took a turn for the worse?{\i0}

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,160
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,170
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,960
Code red! Duck and cover!

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,420
You're all in danger!

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,300
Run for cover!

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,730
Run for your lives!

23
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,850
Emergency! Emergency!

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,430
Look out! Take cover!

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,070
Run for cover!

26
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,530
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,330
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

28
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,580
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

29
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,580
No, no, no!
lt's true! Come with me!

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,170
No. Son? What?

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,420
lt happened under the old oak tree!

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,680
l'm not making this up.
l know it's here.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

34
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,680
...somewhere
on the ground here.

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
lt was shaped like that!

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
- Like a stop sign?
- Yes!

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,940
Only it doesn't say ''stop''
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
And it hit me on the head!

39
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,650
- lt looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

40
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,690
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,410
No, Dad. lt was definitely
a piece of the sky!

42
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,620
Piece of the sky.
lt's OK, everyone!

43
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,620
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,290
lt was just an acorn that hit my son.
A little acorn.

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,830
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,130
This is embarrassing enough already.

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,340
Chicken Little!
What were you thinkin'?

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,510
Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,970
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

50
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,720
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,270
- A big acorn level fluh...
- lt was a big acorn?

52
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,480
- lt was an ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,600
Gesundheit!

54
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,020
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

55
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,070
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

56
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,530
Your kid went and
scared us all half to death!

57
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,820
Well, what can l tell you, folks,
my son,

58
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,910
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. lt's...

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,370
No, Dad. lt wasn't an acorn.

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,580
lt was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,800
You gotta believe me.

62
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,730
A movie. A movie.

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,440
They're makin' a movie.

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,480
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,900
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

66
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,320
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,200
the spoons with your face on it...

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,160
...the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

69
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,080
- You saw them, right?
- l saw them.

70
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,420
Can't eat off 'em.

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,340
- They're not microwave-safe.
- Saw the billboards?

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,050
l saw them.

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,720
There's a bumper sticker.
l knew it was only a matter of time.

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,180
Billboards l could live with.
Posters l could even live with.

75
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,520
But a bumper sticker.
lt's... it's like glued on forever.

76
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,900
lt doesn't matter. You know why?
Because l've got a plan.

77
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,110
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how l told you

78
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,240
it would be better for you to lay low,

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,240
don't call attention to yourself?

80
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,530
- Yes, but l...
- See, it's like a game.

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,620
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except
the goal is never to be found, ever!

82
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,580
Great! Now,
we've got a plan, right?

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,880
l'll see ya later!
Remember, lay low.

84
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah. OK.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,730
Bye.

86
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,150
Look, Mama!
There's the crazy chicken!

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,020
lt is! Crazy chicken. You're smart.
We don't make eye contact. Bye!

88
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,990
That's it. Today is a new day.

89
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,170
{\i1}It was a recipe for disaster{\i0}

90
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,000
{\i1}A four-course meal of ''No sirree''{\i0}

91
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,300
{\i1}It seemed that happily ever after{\i0}

92
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,550
{\i1}Was happy everyone was after me{\i0}

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,470
{\i1}It was a cup of good intentions{\i0}

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,140
{\i1}A tablespoon of one big mess{\i0}

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,560
{\i1}A tablespoon of one big mess{\i0}

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,980
{\i1}A dash of overreaction{\i0}

97
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,940
{\i1}And I assume you know the rest{\i0}

98
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,360
{\i1}And I assume you know the rest{\i0}

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,860
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

100
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,910
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

101
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,910
{\i1}It was a fusion of confusion{\i0}

102
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,120
{\i1}With a few confounding things{\i0}

103
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,590
{\i1}I guess I probably took{\i0}
{\i1}the wrong direction{\i0}

104
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,340
{\i1}Well I admit I might've{\i0}
{\i1}missed a sign or two{\i0}

105
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,100
{\i1}I took a right turn at confusion{\i0}

106
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,680
{\i1}A left when I should've gone{\i0}
{\i1}straight on through{\i0}

107
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,140
{\i1}I ran ahead with my assumptions{\i0}

108
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,270
{\i1}And we all know{\i0}
{\i1}what that can do{\i0}

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,980
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

110
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,780
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

111
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,360
{\i1}It was a fusion of confusion{\i0}

112
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,120
{\i1}And a few confounding things{\i0}

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,870
{\i1}I get the feeling in this town{\i0}
{\i1}I'll never live 'til I live down{\i0}

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
{\i1}The one mistake that seems{\i0}
{\i1}to follow me around{\i0}

115
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,300
{\i1}But they'll forget about the sky{\i0}
{\i1}When they all realize{\i0}

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,720
{\i1}This guy's about to try{\i0}
{\i1}to learn to fly{\i0}

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
{\i1}Or hit the ground{\i0}

118
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,730
How's it going?

119
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,150
{\i1}It was a cup of good intentions{\i0}

120
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,120
{\i1}A tablespoon of one big mess{\i0}

121
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,990
{\i1}A dash of overreaction{\i0}

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,040
{\i1}And I assume you know the rest{\i0}

123
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,170
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

124
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,380
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

125
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
{\i1}It was a humble little stumble{\i0}

126
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,630
{\i1}With a big ungraceful{\i0}

127
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,390
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

128
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,100
{\i1}One little slip{\i0}

129
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,980
{\i1}It was a fusion of confusion{\i0}
{\i1}with a few confounding things{\i0}

130
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,420
Very well. Foxy Loxy.

131
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,080
- Present, pretty and punctual.
- Goosey Loosey.

132
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,130
Master Runt of the Litter.

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,260
Present and accounted for,
Mr Woolensworth.

134
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,180
Dropped my pencil!

135
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,350
- Loser!

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,560
- Here.

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,940
- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.

140
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,580
Quite. Abby Mallard.

141
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,780
Ugly duckling.

142
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,710
Class! l will not tolerate
rude behaviour

143
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,250
- at the expense of a fellow...
- Hey, no worries, Mr Woolensworth.

144
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,130
You mustn't sneak up on me,
Ugly... Abby.

145
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,510
- Where was l?
- Ugly duckling.

146
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,260
Oh, yes.

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,930
Chicken Little.

148
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,560
- Tardy again.
- Tardy again.

149
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,150
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.

150
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,030
He.

151
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,820
She.

152
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,820
They.

153
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,910
We.

154
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,620
OK, everyone. Listen up!

155
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,620
OK, everyone. Listen up!

156
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,620
l don't wanna hear any quacks, tweets,
oinks, whinnies

157
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,880
or cocklee-doodle-doos
when l say... dodgeball.

158
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,800
Oh, man.

159
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,260
Pump it up!
Pump it, pump it, pump it!

160
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,640
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.

161
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,390
- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?

162
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,180
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

163
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,640
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!

164
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,530
Look out!

165
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,240
Calm down, Runt. Just...

166
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Just do what Fish is doing.

167
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,870
{\i1}Everybody dance now{\i0}

168
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,550
- Tough morning?
- A run-in with my old nemesis.

169
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,550
- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won.

170
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,470
Your old foe!

171
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,470
- lncoming on your right.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,950
Yeah, l heard about the movie.
Tough break.

173
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,580
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

174
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,410
That's the least of my problems.

175
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,580
This morning... this morning my dad
told me l should basically disappear.

176
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,460
But that's not gonna get me down.

177
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,710
l've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

178
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,340
No, no, no! this one's good.

179
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Look, one moment destroyed my life,
right? One moment.

180
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,720
- Warthog at 3.00!
- l see him!

181
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,720
- Yes!
- So l figure all l need is a chance...

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,520
All l need is a chance
to do something great

183
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
to make everyone forget the
''sky falling'' thing once and for all.

184
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,940
Then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

185
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,360
Time out!

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Nurse!

187
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,870
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

188
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,120
So, what do you think?

189
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,910
OK, listen.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,830
You said the sky was falling.

191
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,170
- Your dad didn't support you.
- l...

192
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,250
And you have been
hurting inside ever since, right?

193
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,920
- lt's hurt. lt stung. OK?
- lt's hurt, but... Yes.

194
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,880
- That's the nutshell.
- Yes, but...

195
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,720
- No..
- But, it's...

196
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,890
What's got to happen now is
the nut needs to be cracked open.

197
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,690
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

198
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,360
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

199
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,190
Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact!
You see what l'm saying?

200
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,910
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

201
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,790
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

202
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,790
- But...
- Here's the real solution.

203
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,500
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

204
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,830
- Closure?
- Closure,

205
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,380
talking about something
until it's resolved.

206
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,880
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,340
There's a whole section about it
in this month's {\i1}Modern Mallard-{\i0}

208
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,760
- lncredibly appropriate!
- l told you, l have a plan.

209
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,760
Yeah, but according to {\i1}Cosmo Duck,{\i0}

210
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,560
you should
''stop the squawk and try the talk.''

211
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,100
{\i1}Beautiful Duckling{\i0} says,

212
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,730
''Avoiding closure with your
parents can cause early moulting.''

213
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,270
See? Closure.

214
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,940
Come on, repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

215
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,820
Abby, Abby, Abby, listen!
Talking's a waste of time.

216
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,120
l got to do something great
so my dad doesn't think l'm a loser.

217
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Come on. You are not a loser.

218
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,500
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

219
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,080
What?

220
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,420
Yeah... Runt!

221
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,010
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

222
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,970
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

223
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,970
Band-Aid solutions!

224
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,930
- Runt!
- Well, l'm sorry!

225
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,020
l'm very bad at reading facial cues.

226
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,440
Fish, help me out here.

227
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,410
Men.

228
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,460
'Twas beauty that killed the beast.

229
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,670
l guess only girls are good at honest
communication and sensitivity.

230
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,420
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

231
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,890
Prepare to hurt. And l don't
mean emotionally, like l do.

232
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,280
We will save you!

233
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,990
Fall back! Mad goose!

234
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,590
Chicken Little!

235
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,340
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

236
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,050
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

237
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,100
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

238
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,520
Ever since that ''sky falling'' incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

239
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,360
Now look, Buck.

240
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,940
You know l have
the utmost respect for you.

241
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,740
l mean, you were Buck ''Ace'' Cluck,

242
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,860
our school baseball star.

243
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,660
But let's face the facts.

244
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,790
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

245
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,000
OK.

246
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,170
Thank you for talking to me.
l'll take care of my son.

247
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,590
l... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
- lt was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. lt's fine.

249
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,390
You don't have to explain anything.

250
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,660
Hey, Dad?

251
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,710
l was thinkin'.
Yeah, what if l...?

252
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,500
What if...?

253
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,170
What if l joined the baseball team?

254
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,630
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

255
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

256
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,520
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

257
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,350
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when l was small.

258
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,060
l put on five ounces this year.
l've really bulked up.

259
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,860
Really, son?
Baseball. Are you sure?

260
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,820
Oh, yeah, yeah. l mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

261
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

262
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,530
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

263
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,330
You could give me some pointers.

264
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,740
But son, l'm just wondering...

265
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,000
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

266
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,710
Have you considered the chess team
or the glee club?

267
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,760
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

268
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,760
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get stamps.

269
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,680
- l don't like stamps.
- Colours, colourful things...

270
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,100
l was thinkin' baseball!

271
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,180
l can't wait to see
the look on your face

272
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,810
when l smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

273
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,150
Dad... l'm kidding.

274
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,070
That was a... that was a joke.

275
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,570
Just do me one favour, son.

276
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,870
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

277
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,120
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

278
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,040
Yeah, but Dad, l mean, l...

279
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,750
l mean, l think l can...

280
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,140
OK, Dad.

281
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,120
{\i1}I bruise you{\i0}

282
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,910
{\i1}You bruise me{\i0}

283
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,120
{\i1}We both bruise so{\i0}

284
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,580
{\i1}Easily{\i0}

285
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,590
{\i1}Too easily{\i0}

286
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,550
{\i1}To let it show{\i0}

287
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,430
{\i1}I love you{\i0}

288
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,520
{\i1}And that's all I know{\i0}

289
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,900
Oh, Chloe. lf only you were here.

290
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,610
You'd know what to do.

291
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,780
{\i1}And all my plans{\i0}

292
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,280
{\i1}Keep fallin' through{\i0}

293
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,040
{\i1}All my plans, they{\i0}

294
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,080
{\i1}Depend on you{\i0}

295
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,920
{\i1}Depend on you{\i0}

296
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,550
{\i1}To help them grow{\i0}

297
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,920
{\i1}I love you{\i0}

298
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,010
- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!

299
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,220
{\i1}And that's all{\i0}

300
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,560
{\i1}It's really all I know{\i0}

301
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,360
{\i1}It's all I know{\i0}

302
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,660
Come on. All l need is a chance.

303
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,540
{\i1}It's all{\i0}

304
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,420
{\i1}I know{\i0}

305
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,890
{\i1}Yeah{\i0}

306
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,600
{\i1}Ohh{\i0}

307
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,810
{\i1}I can't sit here{\i0}
{\i1}while I go nowhere{\i0}

308
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,030
{\i1}Chase my dreams{\i0}
{\i1}through the polluted air{\i0}

309
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,070
{\i1}Chase my dreams{\i0}
{\i1}through the polluted air{\i0}

310
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,070
{\i1}I'm walking on a wire{\i0}

311
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,650
{\i1}I'm walking on a wire{\i0}

312
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,660
{\i1}Running out of time{\i0}

313
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,870
{\i1}There's no room{\i0}
{\i1}in this ol' heart of mine{\i0}

314
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,370
{\i1}Hungry minds{\i0}
{\i1}just stare you in the eyes{\i0}

315
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,420
{\i1}Spread it thick{\i0}
{\i1}and lay the biggest lies{\i0}

316
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,260
{\i1}Words jump off the pages{\i0}

317
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,420
{\i1}Passion hits the street{\i0}

318
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,850
{\i1}Anger's cooking{\i0}
{\i1}in the city heat{\i0}

319
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,310
{\i1}World's too crazy{\i0}
{\i1}I can't take no more{\i0}

320
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,230
{\i1}I won't stay here{\i0}
{\i1}locked behind the door{\i0}

321
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,610
{\i1}Got to stir it up{\i0}

322
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,690
{\i1}I got to break it up now{\i0}

323
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,570
{\i1}When I think about tomorrow{\i0}

324
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,740
{\i1}Ooh, I can't wait to{\i0}

325
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,120
{\i1}Stir it up{\i0}
{\i1}Got to shake it up now{\i0}

326
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
{\i1}If I have to beg or borrow{\i0}

327
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,620
{\i1}I'm not gonna take it anymore{\i0}

328
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,960
{\i1}Oh-oh oh-ohh-oh oh-ohh-oh{\i0}
{\i1}Come on{\i0}

329
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,460
{\i1}Oh-oh oh-ohh-oh oh-ohh-oh{\i0}
{\i1}Come on{\i0}

330
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,420
{\i1}So much pressure{\i0}
{\i1}to keep holding on{\i0}

331
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,630
{\i1}Whoa{\i0}

332
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,340
{\i1}Pack my clothes up, baby{\i0}

333
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,050
{\i1}I'll be gone{\i0}

334
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,770
{\i1}Stir it up{\i0}
{\i1}Got to break it up now{\i0}

335
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,430
{\i1}When I think about tomorrow{\i0}

336
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,980
{\i1}When I think about tomorrow{\i0}

337
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,940
{\i1}I can't wait to{\i0}
{\i1}Stir it up{\i0}

338
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,650
{\i1}I can't wait to{\i0}
{\i1}Stir it up{\i0}

339
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,900
{\i1}I got to shake it up now{\i0}

340
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
{\i1}I got to shake it up now{\i0}

341
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,610
{\i1}If I have to beg or borrow{\i0}

342
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,610
{\i1}I'm not gonna take it no more{\i0}

343
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,030
{\i1}I'm not gonna take it no more{\i0}

344
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,780
{\i1}Lean to the left{\i0}
{\i1}Lean to the right{\i0}

345
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,290
{\i1}C'mon Acorns{\i0}
{\i1}Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!{\i0}

346
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,130
There's excitement in the air,
ladies and gentlemen.

347
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,470
lt's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

348
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,430
the Spud Valley Taters.

349
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,800
Down by only a single run,
with a player in scoring position...

350
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,100
...we have a chance.

351
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,310
This excitement isn't about
the fun of baseball, the prize.

352
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,230
lt's about the gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

353
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,940
the ''Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!'' taunting

354
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,940
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

355
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,530
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and Mayor Turkey Lurkey

356
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,540
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

357
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,880
This battle has taken a heavy toll
on our hometown heroes.

358
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,920
After nine gruelling innings
and several players out with injuries,

359
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,090
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

360
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,470
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

361
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,350
Up next... Chicken Little.

362
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
Clearly a long shot, folks.

363
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,650
Little hasn't been up to bat once
since joining the team.

364
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,950
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- But wait!

365
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,280
lf he can just get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse,

366
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,240
Foxy Loxy can step up
and save us all.

367
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,620
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

368
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,380
OK, kid, listen up.

369
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,170
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

370
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,550
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

371
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,340
- l have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

372
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,800
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

373
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,270
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

374
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,770
Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold
the pine, Little advances to the box.

375
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,610
He's going to bat from the right.

376
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,820
Make it the left. No, the right.

377
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,110
- The right.
- Easy out!

378
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Looks like left field's
found something better to do,

379
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,040
centre field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

380
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,040
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

381
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,460
Why him? Why now?

382
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,340
l won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

383
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,510
Here's the wind-up, the pitch!
lt's a high cutter.

384
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,180
Ball!

385
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,310
Strike one!

386
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,850
l'm not going to sugar-coat it.
l've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

387
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,780
The catcher lays down the signals.
Here's the pitch.

388
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,070
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

389
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,990
Strike two!

390
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,950
l said, don't swing!

391
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,450
Don't swing!

392
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,330
- No!
- Batter up!

393
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,050
Two in the hole!

394
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,380
One more strike, it's a punch out,
folks, and we're all going home.

395
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,260
Today is a new day.

396
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,770
Don't swing!

397
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,950
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
lt's a hit!

398
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,160
- A hit?
- A hit?

399
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,750
A hit?

400
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,550
But wait! The batter
is still at home plate.

401
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,880
He's standing in a daze.
Run, kid, run!

402
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,930
Go, son! Run! Run!

403
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,060
There he goes,
headed the wrong way.

404
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,270
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

405
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,440
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

406
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,650
Wait! He's turned!
l've never said these words before,

407
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,860
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

408
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,860
- Goosey Loosey steps on home...
- Today's a new day!

409
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,780
We have a tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

410
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,120
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the centre fielder!

411
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,540
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

412
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,670
Catch is complete,
but where's the ball?

413
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,710
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

414
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,680
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

415
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,890
- lt's stuck! lt's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

416
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,930
lt's the old tip-the-cow play.

417
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,480
The kid heads for the hot corner,
a triple!

418
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,520
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

419
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,730
He's going for the whole enchilada!

420
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,730
The ball of wax,
kit and caboodle!

421
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,980
Go back!
You're never gonna make it!

422
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,030
He's trying to lighten his load!

423
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,490
The outfield behind him,
on all cylinders!

424
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,740
He slides for the dish!

425
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,660
lt's going to be a photo finish at home!

426
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,750
You're out!

427
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,430
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

428
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,260
- Wait!
- Wait, wait!

429
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,310
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

430
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,190
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

431
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,310
He's...

432
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,780
Safe! The runner is safe!

433
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,120
lt's all over, folks!
The Acorns have done the impossible!

434
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,950
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

435
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,130
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

436
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,090
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

437
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,800
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

438
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,130
That was a lucky hit!

439
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,930
Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!

440
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,510
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

441
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,980
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks in your undies

442
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,890
and chafes for hours!

443
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,940
This is one memory
you'll savour forever!

444
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,820
Yeah!

445
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,540
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

446
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,750
That's my boy!

447
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,010
{\i1}I am the champion, my friend{\i0}

448
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,140
{\i1}And I'll keep on fightin'{\i0}
{\i1}till the end{\i0}

449
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,650
{\i1}I am the champion{\i0}

450
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,230
{\i1}I am the champion{\i0}

451
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,490
{\i1}But gone is the loser{\i0}

452
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,990
{\i1}'Cause I am the champion{\i0}

453
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,160
{\i1}Of the world{\i0}

454
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,290
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

455
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,920
- A knuckleball!
- He swings!

456
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,130
- Crack!
- lt's going.

457
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,930
- He rounds first, second!
- Hits high off the wall!

458
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,090
Flies past third
and heads for the plate!

459
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,100
lt's a scramble for the ball!
lt's gonna be close!

460
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,310
He is safe!

461
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,310
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

462
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,100
The mighty Acorns win!

463
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,830
Geez, you know,

464
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,250
l guess that puts the whole
''sky is falling'' incident

465
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,670
behind us once and for all.
Hey, kiddo?

466
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,840
You bet, Dad.

467
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,630
Unless you think we need... closure?

468
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,430
Closure? What's to close here?

469
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,350
Unless you think we need to close...

470
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,680
- Not me.
- lt's closed!

471
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,770
- l agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

472
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,940
OK, great, Dad. You...
Closure, l dunno.

473
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,650
All right. Enough fun.

474
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,990
Good talk. Good talk, son.

475
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,500
- Here, l'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

476
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,670
- OK.
- OK, l'm up.

477
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,290
Hey.

478
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,880
Good night, Ace.

479
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,090
Here's the wind-up...
and the pitch!

480
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,780
Thanks.

481
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Thanks for the chance.

482
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,280
No!

483
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,740
A piece of the sky?!
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

484
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,910
Hey! Son!
You all right? l'm coming!

485
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,080
l'm coming! l'm comin' upstairs!

486
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,290
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

487
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,340
You sure?
l thought l heard you yell.

488
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,670
No.

489
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,260
l fell out of bed.

490
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

491
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,140
- There. There!
- Where?

492
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,470
How'd you get over there?

493
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,980
Who're we talking about?

494
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,730
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

495
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,570
Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

496
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,040
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...

497
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,960
Good.

498
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,940
No.

499
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,880
No.

500
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,980

513
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,730

- Runt!

516
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,570
Hey! Where are you?

517
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,370
- We already started. We were just...
- {\i1}It opened up!{\i0}

518
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,490
What?!

519
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,670
All right, guys. Watch this.

520
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,460
Bizarre.

521
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,760
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

522
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,340
- Well...
- l knew it!

523
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,720
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

524
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,930
- ''you, your dad, talk-talk-talking.''
- There was talking.

525
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,520
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

526
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,020
What?

527
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,070
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

528
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,360
You have got to stop messing
around and deal with the problem!

529
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,160
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

530
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,370
This is what
fell on me the first time.

531
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,740
There's no way l'm
bringing this up again.

532
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,040
- No, he's not.
- Runt!

533
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,540
Sorry! l'm a gutless flip-flopper.

534
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,170
OK. l'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

535
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,630
l mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

536
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,260
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

537
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,050
l don't care. l want it
out of my life, gone for good.

538
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,800
Everything back to normal.

539
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,480
Hey, remember when that
icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

540
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,140
Everybody thought
it was from space and stuff?

541
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,690
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

542
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,530
Yeah, that's right.
lt's frozen pee.

543
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,910
Yeah. lt's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

544
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,450
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

545
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,620
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

546
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,040
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

547
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,620
OK, subject change.

548
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,540
- Make pishee?
- l don't care what it is!

549
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,460
Are you gonna help me
get rid of it or not?

550
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,690
Flying Fish! Take cover!

551
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,110
Fish!

552
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,990
- No!
- Fish!

553
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,090
Come on, come on, come on!

554
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,340
Come on, come on, come on!

555
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,920
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

556
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,850
Chicken Little has something to
tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

557
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,810
Who're we talkin' about?

558
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,270
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

559
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,860
You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

560
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,530
even if they have nothing to say.

561
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,870
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

562
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,500
l'm sorry! Wait!

563
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,750
Sorry!

564
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,210
Curb!

565
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,660
Fish!

566
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,060
Abby!

567
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,860
Abby! Wake up!

568
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,110
Come on! Let's get outta here!

569
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,450
Oh, poor Fish!

570
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,250
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

571
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,710
...maybe he's a half-living host
implanted with face-hugging babies.

572
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,130
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

573
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,010
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

574
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,220
Oh, snap.

575
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,500
Fish.

576
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,580
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

577
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,090
Fish.

578
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Fish.

579
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,890
Fish.

580
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,060
Fish.

581
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,810
Where are you, Fish?!

582
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,770
l can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

583
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,360
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

584
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,900
l'll jeopardise the mission!
Endanger us all!

585
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,570
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

586
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:56,120
Just leave me some ammo, little
water, some chips if you have 'em.

587
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,830
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.

588
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,910
- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.

589
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,870
- Now breathe.
- Breathe.

590
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,120
- No, slowly.
- Slowly.

591
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,540
Slowly.

592
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,090
OK. Now, just do
the thing you do to relax.

593
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,390
{\i1}Well, you can tell by the way{\i0}

594
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,680
{\i1}I use my walk I'm a woman's man{\i0}

595
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,060
{\i1}No time to talk{\i0}

596
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,110
{\i1}Stayin' alive, stayin' alive'{\i0}

597
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,160
Fish!

598
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,000
Fish! Are you OK?

599
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,920
Did they hurt you? Say something!

600
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,710
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.

601
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,420
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?

602
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,740
We're next.

603
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,080
Run!

604
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,410
OK! That's it!

605
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,000
We're running back to your house.
Tell your dad!

606
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,710
OK! You're right!

607
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,490
{\i1}Stayin' alive, stayin' alive{\i0}

608
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,110
{\i1}Stayin' alive{\i0}

609
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh, Runt!

610
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,040
Push! Push! No!

611
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,000
- Runt!
- No! Not pull! Push!

612
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:16,130
We gotta get outta here right now!
Come on...

613
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,970
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...

614
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,340
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

615
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,100
OK, time out!

616
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,850
So... have you been to the mall?

617
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,820
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

618
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,110
l'm sorry.

619
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,070
Tension makes me bloat.

620
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,710
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

621
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,620
Look out!

622
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,950
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!

623
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,210
What's that noise?

624
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,380
Sorry. Nervous eater.

625
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,630
- Run!
- Wait! Fish!

626
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:29,680
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

627
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,180
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

628
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,270

629
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,000
Hurry! Hurry!

630
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,210
Go! Go!

631
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,810
lt's locked!

632
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,650
They're... they're comin'.

Come on, buddy.

Work! You work!

What happened?
l blacked out there for a second.

641

{\i1}The sky is falling!{\i0}
{\i1}The sky is falling!{\i0}

642
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,540
{\i1}It was just an acorn- A little acorn!{\i0}

643
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,130
{\i1}I can't tell you{\i0}
{\i1}how embarrassed I am, folks-{\i0}

644
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,460

Come on, Chicken Little!

{\i1}The alarm bell has been activated!{\i0}
{\i1}Quick! Get a camera crew!{\i0}

650
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,730
Chicken Little! You better have
a good explanation for this!

658
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,140
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

659
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,720
Quick! Quick! lt's taking off!

660
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,390
Come on! lf you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

661
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,480
Oh, look! A penny!

662
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,820
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

663
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,320
Hurry! Hurry!

664
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,570
Come on! Quick! lt's taking off!

665
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,290
Come on! Hurry up! Please!
lt's right in...

666
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,580
- What are we lookin' for?
- l don't know.

667
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,330
- What are we lookin' for?
- l don't know.

668
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,670
Yeah. OK. l know this looks bad,

669
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,630
but there's an
invisible spaceship right there

670
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,840
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

671
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,760
Let me show you.

672
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,680
Bad throw.

673
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,810
OK, let me try again.

674
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,520
- Bad throw.
- We all know l don't have a good arm,

675
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,150
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

676
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,900
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me on the head.

677
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,740
lt's the acorn thing all over again.

678
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,860
There's no story.

679
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,660
At least we can sell
the video to {\i1}Chickens Gone Wild-{\i0}

680
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,120
- l'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

681
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,660
lt's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

682
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,040
And maps with planets
with X's through them!

683
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,340
Runt, that's enough!

684
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,380
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

685
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,300
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

686
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,300
Why can't you keep that
child of yours under control?

687
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,850
- What kind of parent are you?
- Everybody, l'm telling the truth.

688
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:27,390
Dad! Dad! l'm not making this up!

689
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,900
You gotta believe me this time.

690
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,240
No, son. l don't.

691
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,830
l can't tell you
how embarrassed l am, folks.

692
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,130
l'm really sorry about this, everyone.

693
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,960
Looks like this is just

694
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,180
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

695
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,680
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

696
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,520
Mr Cluck, don't take it so hard.
No one blames you.

697
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:17,420
Emergency, emergency!
Send help!

698
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,260
{\i1}Reports of panic and mayhem{\i0}
{\i1}are pouring in{\i0}

699
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,220
{\i1}after yet another{\i0}
{\i1}Chicken Little incident last night-{\i0}

700
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,600
{\i1}In one instance, a family{\i0}
{\i1}of lemmings was sent running in fear,{\i0}

701
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,190
{\i1}but unable to find a cliff,{\i0}
{\i1}they instead began throwing themselves{\i0}

702
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,860
- {\i1}from the nearest park bench-{\i0}
- Hello? l'm sorry.

703
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,030
Hello? l apologise.
Hello? Give me break! Hello?

704
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,820
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

705
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,030
l thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

706
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,580
{\i1}You have hate mail-{\i0}

707
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:51,160
- l'm truly sorry. That wasn't funny.
- {\i1}You have more hate mail-{\i0}

708
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,120
Hi. What are you saying, sir?

709
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,210
{\i1}Your hate mail box is full-{\i0}

710
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,130
Oh, yes.
l do see the skywriting there.

711
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,760
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

712
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,720
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch your mouth. Yeah?

713
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,470
Oh, yeah?
Well, l'd like to see you try.

714
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,390
OK, l love you too, Mom. Bye.

715
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,770
Hello? Really. Well...

716
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,960
lf there was ever a time
to talk to your dad, it's now.

717
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,970
lt's too late for that.

718
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,220
lt's too late, baby,
now it's too late.

719
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,270
Though they really
did try to make it.

720
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,020
Runt.

721
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,390
Just think about it.

722
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,150
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

723
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,940
and they just can't fake it.
Oh, no, no.

724
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,740
Runt, l just really want
to be alone right now.

725
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,090
Abby! Runt! Fish!

726
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,340
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

727
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,510
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

728
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,650
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

729
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,360
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

730
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,400
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

731
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,820
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

732
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,530
Here, blow.

733
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,290
OK.

734
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,920
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

735
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,230
Run!

736
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,620
Those are your parents?

737
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,410
And they brought the galactic armada?

738
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,920
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

739
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,880
- l gotta tell you something.
- What?

740
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,380
l know, l know! You were right!
Alien invasion. l see that now.

741
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,390
- Look up! There it is!
- Dad, you know, about that...

742
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:37,390
- lt's actually a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

743
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:40,270
This alien kid was left
and they're coming to get him!

744
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:43,060
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who will?

745
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,650
What?!

746
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,440
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

747
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,110
Son!

748
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,160
Son, come back!
Son! Chicken Little!

749
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,950
Mr Cluck! Wait!
He's telling the truth!

750
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:04,170
He is! Though, given his track record,
we understand why you don't believe him!

751
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,420
{\i1}It's the end of the world{\i0}
{\i1}as we know it{\i0}

752
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,590
{\i1}It's the end of the world{\i0}
{\i1}as we know it{\i0}

753
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,470
ls there any sign of him?

754
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,640
Negative.

755
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,640
We'll have to send in the ground troops.

756
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,980
{\i1}And I feel fine{\i0}

757
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,810
{\i1}It's the end of the world{\i0}
{\i1}as we know it{\i0}

758
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,320
{\i1}It's the end of the world{\i0}
{\i1}as we know it{\i0}

759
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,070
{\i1}It's the end of the world{\i0}
{\i1}as we know it{\i0}

760
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,990
{\i1}And I feel fine{\i0}

761
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:53,050
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

762
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:17,820
Chicken Little!

763
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,530
Chicken Little!

764
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,160
What? Where's your head?

765
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,450
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come o...

766
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,250
- You, with the running and jumping!
- Dad. Wait.

767
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,580
What are you doing?
We gotta get outta here!

768
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,630
lt's like
{\i1}War of the Worlds{\i0} out there!

769
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,170
- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for a second!

770
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,510
- lt's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

771
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:38,180
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

772
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,680
- You're never there for me!
- What?

773
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,730
That's not what l had in mind, but...

774
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,690
You're never there for me.
l mean,

775
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,020
you were when l won the game,
but not when l thought the sky fell.

776
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,940
And not at the ball field
and not now!

777
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,860
This is good!
Keep going!

778
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,200
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

779
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,490
We have to talk because
{\i1}Modern Mallard{\i0} says avoiding closure

780
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,660
can lead to moulting.
l'm already small

781
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,120
and l don't think
l could handle being bald!

782
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,960
l didn't... realise, son.

783
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,550
l never meant to...

784
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,800
The acorn, the sky,
l mean, the whole...

785
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,520
You're right. You're right.

786
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,730
Your mom, she was...

787
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,820
You know, she was
always good with stuff like this.

788
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,910
Me...

789
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,540
...l'm gonna need a lot of work.

790
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,460
But you need to know
that l love you,

791
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,050
no matter what.

792
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,510
And l'm sorry l....

793
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,640
And l'm sorry if l ever made
you feel like that was something...

794
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,690
...you had to earn.

795
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,830
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

796
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,870
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

797
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,670
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

798
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,880
Return this whatever it is?

799
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,720
This is crazy! Crazy!

800
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,550
Crazy wonderful!

801
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,640
Just tell me what you need me to do.

802
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,270
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

803
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,980
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

804
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,030
Crazy supportive. That's me!

805
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:02,400
This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it?

806
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,120
By the way, l'd like to say l've
always found you extremely attractive!

807
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,050
Now that's closure.

808
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:27,140
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!

809
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:34,810
They've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

810
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,150
OK, son. What do we do now?

811
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,940
OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

812
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:44,740
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

813
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:50,370
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

814
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,710
Key to my car?

815
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,540
Tic Tac?

816
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,880
Forget plan A!

817
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,270
OK, OK, what now, son?

818
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,770
Who, by the way,
l support 1 00 percent.

819
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,610
- Plan B?
- Of course! Plan B! What is plan B?

820
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,570
You have to go to the bathroom?
You want juice?

821
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,700
A snack?
Corn dog on a stick?

822
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,910
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

823
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,080
l stink at this.
l'm a horrible father.

824
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,670
No, no, no, l am. l am.

825
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,510
ls that your parents?

826
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,140
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

827
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,430
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

828
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,890
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

829
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,480
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

830
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,150
and give the kid
back to its parents.

831
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,360
Yeah!

832
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,490
Charge!

833
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,680
Now that's what
l call takin' out the trash!

834
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,900
OK, son. Now what?

835
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,280
Fire truck!

836
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,030
Plan C!

837
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,120
Runt, no! Turn around!

838
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,290
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporise us!

839
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,130
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! lt'll work!

840
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,220
We'll survive!

841
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,590
l will survive?

842
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,760
Brake, Abby!

843
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,680
OK.

844
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,180
Floor it!

845
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,480
Deploy ladder, Fish!

846
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,160
{\i1}I'll survive{\i0}

847
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,290
{\i1}I will survive{\i0}
{\i1}Hey, hey{\i0}

848
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,830
Plan D.

849
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,840
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

850
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,470
But loving you!
Full support!

851
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,070
l can't get out!
Come back, son!

852
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,280
We can't go out this way!
lt's dangerous.

853
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,610
- Dad, l can do this!
- lt's too dangerous.

854
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,740
l can do this. l can.

855
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,160
You gotta believe me this time.

856
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,790
l...

857
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,160
l do, son.

858
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,710
OK, hang on tight.

859
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,310
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

860
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,060
Here's your kid!

861
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,810
He's OK!

862
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,650
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

863
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,660
Son! Son!

864
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,290
- l'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

865
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,290
Get away from my boy! Get away!

866
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,220
The mighty Acorns...

867
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,520
Tic Tac?

868
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,530
Why did you take our child?

869
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:38,160
Just... Just hold on there, buddy!

870
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,370
My son did not take your kid!

871
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,410
You were the one
that left him behind!

872
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:45,250
That's bad parenting!
And l should know!

873
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,500
Silence!

874
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,630
Release the child!

875
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:53,710
- OK.
- OK, OK.

876
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,350
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
l'm so happy to see you! My darling!

877
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,430
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

878
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,520
They got their kid.

879
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,650
You have violated
intergalactic law 9021 0!

880
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:14,610
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

881
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,160
Oh, snap.

882
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,330
What's that?

883
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,670
l don't quite...

884
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:32,210
Melvin, honey? He's saying
they're telling the truth.

885
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,130
lt was just a misunderstanding.

886
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,430
Well, then. This is awkward.

887
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,470
- Yes, it is.
- l suppose l should...

888
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,260
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

889
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,140
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

890
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:52,020
- And turn off your big voice.
- But l don't...

891
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,400
- Turn it off.
- But...

892
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,990
But l don't get to use
the big voice very often!

893
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,530
Melvin.

894
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,860
Yes, dear.

895
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:08,160
Hi. Anyone want
to try the big voice?

896
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:17,090
Again, l cannot tell you how sorry
we are for this whole misunderstanding.

897
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:19,470
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

898
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,970
We are. And if it
hadn't been for your son there,

899
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:24,810
well, we might have
vaporised the whole planet.

900
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,970
What?

901
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,390
Goodness!
What a shame that would have been.

902
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,350
- Tell 'em!
- Where would we pick acorns?

903
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,400
We stop here on the way to the in-laws.

904
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,190
- Every year.
- Looked on all the other planets.

905
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:37,530
- You only find them on Earth.
- lt says here.

906
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,110
That caught our eyes.

907
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,240
OK, everything's
been put back to normal,

908
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,490
except for this one, over here.

909
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,290
Hi, y'all!

910
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,410
Foxy?

911
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,290
{\i1}Lollipop, lollipop{\i0}
{\i1}Oh, lolli lolli lolli{\i0}

912
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,420
{\i1}Lollipop---{\i0}

913
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,590
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

914
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,050
No worries!
We can put her back the way she was.

915
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,470
No! She's perfect.

916
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,430
{\i1}Lollipop!{\i0}
{\i1}Lollipop!{\i0}

917
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,260
Scary.

918
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,640
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

919
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,980
All right, then.
lt was good meetin' ya.

920
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,900
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

921
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,440
But, hey, l'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

922
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:22,610
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

923
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:28,700
There goes that panel again.

924
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,910
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

925
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,330
Seriously, honey, someday it's
gonna hit somebody on the head.

926
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,000
- Nonsense!
- You can't return the panel, can you?

927
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:40,050
- That's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

928
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,170
Silence!

929
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:44,550
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

930
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,720
Who we talkin' about?

931
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,270
So l'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

932
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:55,690
So l'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

933
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,400
l just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

934
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,150
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

935
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,360
One thing they'll never do...

936
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,160
...is mess with a good story.

937
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,070
...is mess with a good story.

938
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:12,960
Red alert! Man your battle stations!
Status report, Mr Fish.

939
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,040
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

940
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,500
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

941
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,130
But that means...

942
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,340
Yes, l know.
The sky... is falling.

943
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,090
Commander Little! No!

944
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,970
Please... call me...

945
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,520
...Ace.

946
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,310
Oh, Ace! No!

947
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,690
l never intended
to bring you into this... Abby.

948
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,070
- Runt, do you copy?
- {\i1}Yes, commander?{\i0}

949
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:44,240
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

950
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,950
Civilization as we know it
depends on me

951
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:51,700
and, to a lesser extent... you.

952
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,330
So l've just got one question for you:

953
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,920
Are you ready to rock?

954
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,130
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

955
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,220
{\i1}Ain't no mountain high enough{\i0}

956
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,550
Raise your pork shield, Runt.
Prepare to engage.

957
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,310
{\i1}Stay on target-{\i0}
{\i1}Stay on target!{\i0}

958
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,650
{\i1}Give 'em a taste{\i0}
{\i1}of the other white meat!{\i0}

959
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,360
{\i1}Cap'n! Look out!{\i0}

960
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,480
{\i1}Runt!{\i0}

961
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,070
{\i1}Runt, are you all right?{\i0}

962
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:27,240
{\i1}No, no- Ya gotta go on{\i0}
{\i1}without me, commander-{\i0}

963
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,160
{\i1}Just leave me some ammo,{\i0}
{\i1}a little water,{\i0}

964
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,200
{\i1}some chips if you have 'em-{\i0}

965
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:38,210
This is amazingly accurate.

966
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,920
{\i1}He was my good friend-{\i0}

967
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,670
{\i1}Oh, Abby-{\i0}

968
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,340
{\i1}At least I still have you--- Abby-{\i0}

969
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,430
- {\i1}Ace!{\i0}
- {\i1}Abby-{\i0}

970
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:55,060
- {\i1}Ace!{\i0}
- {\i1}Abby-{\i0}

971
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,060
{\i1}Ace!{\i0}

972
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,560
{\i1}Good people of Oakey Oaks-{\i0}

973
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:05,230
{\i1}Though at times it may feel{\i0}
{\i1}like the sky is falling around you,{\i0}

974
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,650
{\i1}never give up-{\i0}

975
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:11,240
{\i1}For every day--- is a new day!{\i0}

976
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,740
{\i1}A new day!{\i0}

977
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:16,160
{\i1}Ain't no mountain high enough{\i0}

978
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,120
{\i1}Ain't no valley low enough{\i0}

979
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,750
{\i1}Oh, Ace!{\i0}

980
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,210
{\i1}To keep me from you{\i0}

981
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,920
{\i1}Ain't no mountain high enough{\i0}

982
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,220
{\i1}Ain't no valley low enough{\i0}

983
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,380
{\i1}Ain't no river wild enough{\i0}

984
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,890
{\i1}To keep me from you{\i0}

985
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:37,470
{\i1}Ain't no mountain high enough{\i0}

986
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,270
{\i1}Nothing can keep me{\i0}
