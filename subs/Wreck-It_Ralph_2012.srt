2
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,633
My name's Ralph, and l'm a bad guy.

3
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's see. l'm nine feet tall.
l weigh 643 pounds.

4
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,308
Got a little bit of a temper on me.

5
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,106
My passion bubbles
very near the surface,

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,150
l guess, not gonna lie.

7
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,154
Anyhoo, what else?

8
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,949
l'm a wrecker. l wreck things.
Professionally.

9
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,620
l'm very good at what l do.
Probably the best l know.

10
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,749
The thing is, fixing
is the name of the game.

11
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,501
Literally, Fix-It Felix, Jr.

12
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,339
So, yeah, naturally,

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,176
the guy with the name
Fix-lt Felix is the good guy.

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,136
He's nice enough as good guys go.

15
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,138
Definitely fixes stuff really well.

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,350
But if you've got a magic hammer
from your father,

17
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,019
how hard can it be?

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,355
lf he was a regular contractor
carpenter guy,

19
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,900
l guarantee you would not be able

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,027
to fix the damage that l do as quickly.

21
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,031
And when Felix does
a good job, he gets a medal.

22
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,243
But are there medals for
wrecking stuff really well?

23
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,204
To that l say, "Ha!"

24
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,916
And, no, there aren't.

25
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,213
Thirty years l've been doing this

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,090
and l've seen a lot of
other games come and go.

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,344
Kind of sad. l think about
all those guys from Asteroids.

28
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,804
Boom! Gone. Centipede?

29
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,723
Who knows where
that guy is, you know?

30
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,809
Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.

31
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,019
l'm very lucky.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,481
lt's just, l got to say,

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,108
it becomes kind of hard to love yourjob

34
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,444
when no one seems to
like you for doing it.

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,700
All clear! The arcade is closed !

36
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,369
Shoryuken !

37
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,456
Whoo! What a day! You want to
head to Tappers, Ken?

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,999
If you're buying, buddy.

39
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,129
Quitting time!

40
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,851
l don't know.

41
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,478
Maybe l wouldn't be feeling this way

42
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,605
if things were different after work.

43
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,066
But it is what it is.

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,234
Good job, everyone!

45
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,819
Felix and the Nicelanders

46
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,779
go hang out in their homes

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,448
which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...

48
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,328
They go to their homes, l go to mine

49
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,290
which happens to be a dump.

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,041
And when l say "a dump,"

51
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,459
l don't mean like a shabby place.

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,045
l mean an actual dump,

53
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,298
where the garbage goes

54
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,676
and a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts...

55
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,345
That's what l call home.

56
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,639
l guess l can't bellyache too much.

57
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,309
l got my bricks, l got my stump.

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,399
lt looks uncomfortable.
lt's actually fine. l'm good.

59
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,657
But if l'm really honest with myself...

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,495
l see Felix up there
getting patted on the back,

61
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,666
people are giving him pie
and thanking him

62
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,836
and so happy to see him all the time.

63
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,088
Sometimes I think. . .

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,344
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

65
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,724
Nice share, Ralph.

66
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,184
As fellow bad guys,

67
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,685
we've all felt what you're feeling

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,187
and we've come to terms with it.

69
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,730
-Really?
-Right here.

70
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,815
I am Zangief. I am bad guy.

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,109
-Hi, Zangief!
-Hi, Zangief.

72
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,237
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

73
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,864
I was crushing man's skull

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,700
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

75
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,954
And I think, "Why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief?

76
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,540
"Why can't you be more like good guy?"

77
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,210
Then I have moment of clarity.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,212
If Zangief is good guy,

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,255
who'll crush man's skull

80
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,549
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,802
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy,

82
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,263
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy."

83
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,395
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

84
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,979
-Zombie! Bad guy!
-Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
Hi, Zombie.

86
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,943
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

87
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,237
Good ! Bad !

88
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,740
You must love you.

89
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,159
-Yeah ! Inside here!
-Yes.

90
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,329
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,497
Question, Ralph.

92
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,125
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

93
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,294
and tonight you finally show up.

94
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,171
-Why is that?
-I don't know.

95
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,589
I just felt like coming.

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,010
I suppose it has
something to do with the fact that. . .

97
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,305
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

98
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,307
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

99
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,642
Thanks, Satan.

100
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,270
It's Sateen, actually.

101
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
Got it. But here's the thing.

102
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,026
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

103
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,490
You can't mess with
the program, Ralph.

104
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,243
You're not going Turbo, are you?

105
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,663
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

106
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,666
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

107
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,710
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

108
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,503
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

109
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,963
Yes!

110
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,965
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

111
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,009
But we can't change who we are.

112
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,343
And the sooner you accept that,

113
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,805
the better off your game
and your life will be.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,100
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

115
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,728
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

116
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,319
I'm bad, and that's good.

117
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,156
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

118
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,533
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

119
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,578
Okay, gang, see you next week.

120
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,580
Listen, I can't do snacks next week.

121
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,207
Hang in there, Ralph.

122
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,709
Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets.

123
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,877
There you go.

124
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,274
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,442
Random my behind !
You always stop me.

126
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,778
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

127
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,572
-Name?
-Lara Croft.

128
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,240
-Name?
-Wreck-It Ralph !

129
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,741
And where are you coming from?

130
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,201
Pac-Man.

131
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,703
Did you bring any fruit with you?

132
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,288
No! No. No fruit.

133
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,706
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,832
Fix-lt Felix Jr.

135
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,750
-Anything to declare?
-I hate you.

136
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,586
I get that a lot. Proceed.

137
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,508
Bad guy coming !

138
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,053
lf you leave your game,

139
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,097
stay safe, stay alert,

140
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,558
and whatever you do, don't die.

141
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,810
Because if you die
outside your own game

142
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
you don't regenerate.

143
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,272
Ever. Game over.

144
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,491
Here you go, buddy.

145
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,662
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

146
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,289
Hang in there, guys.

147
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,583
Name?

148
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,995
"Happy 30th Anniversary"?

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,414
They're having a party without me.

150
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,920
Pac-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

151
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,422
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

152
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,924
isn't even part of this game!

153
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,801
Great party, Felix.

154
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,260
Why, thank you, friend.

155
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,221
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

156
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,189
Fix-It Felix! Fix-It Felix!

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,025
I'll bet that's Mario.

158
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,444
Fashionably late, per the norm.

159
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,071
I'll get it, Felix.

160
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,911
It's Ralph !

161
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,164
-He'll wreck the party!
-Hide the stemware!

162
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,249
Get rid of him, Felix.

163
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,043
Oh, right. I'll go talk to him.

164
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,712
Carry on, everyone.

165
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,632
Ralph, can I help you?

166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,551
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

167
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,594
I saw a big explosion

168
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,055
or something go over the building there.

169
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,808
Those were just fireworks.

170
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,309
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

171
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,103
Somebody's birthday, or. . .

172
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,441
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

173
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,152
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

174
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,195
What? Is that today?

175
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,405
I know!

176
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,906
I'm such a dummy with dates.

177
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,284
Anyway, congratulations.

178
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,579
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

179
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,504
Just a heads-up, Felix.

180
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,630
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

181
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,550
-Hey, Glen.
-Ralph.

182
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,679
Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.

183
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,972
Never had it.

184
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,432
No one ever seems to throw it out

185
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,600
so it never ends up in the dump.

186
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,436
I never actually tasted it.

187
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,272
I've always wanted to try cake.

188
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,108
I don't suppose you'd like to

189
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,777
come in and have a slice, would you?

190
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,279
Hey-o, everybody!

191
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,746
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

192
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,625
-Now, you all know Ralph.
-Evening.

193
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,213
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana. . .

194
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,131
-Deanna.
-Big Gene!

195
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,591
Why is he here?

196
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,843
He's just here for a slice of cake.

197
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,720
And I'm a big part of the game,

198
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,305
technically speaking.

199
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,140
Why are you here, Gene?

200
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,683
Oh, look! The cake!

201
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,106
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, Mary.

202
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,651
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

203
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,071
Each apartment
is everyone's favorite flavor.

204
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,823
Norwood's is red velvet.

205
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,907
Guilty!

206
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,494
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

207
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,037
-and for Felix. . .
-Hey, Mary.

208
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,667
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

209
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,670
Oh. Chocolate.

210
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,256
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

211
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,174
Well, I did not know that.

212
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,467
One other little thing.

213
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:44,096
I hate to be picky,
but this angry little guy here. . .

214
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,139
-My cake!
-. . .might be a lot happier

215
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,600
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

216
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,853
See that? Look at that smile.

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,021
No, no. You see, Ralph,

218
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,190
there's no room for you up here.

219
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,777
What about this? We can make room.

220
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,572
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

221
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,533
How about we just eat the cake?

222
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,994
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

223
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,037
because he's about to get his medal !

224
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,415
Then how about we just take that medal

225
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,833
and give it to Ralph for once?

226
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,543
Would that be
the end of the world, Gene?

227
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,378
Now you're just being ridiculous.

228
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,171
Only good guys win medals,

229
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,799
and you, sir, are no good guy.

230
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,342
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

231
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,510
and I could win a medal !

232
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,513
And when you do, come and talk to us.

233
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,308
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

234
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,434
If you won a medal,

235
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,436
we'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

236
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,479
But it will never happen

237
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,649
because you're just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.

238
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,318
No, I'm not.

239
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,569
Yes, you are!

240
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,321
No, I'm not!

241
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,916
Yes, you are.

242
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,086
All right, Gene. You know what?

243
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,671
I'm going to win a medal.

244
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,257
Oh, I am going to win a medal !

245
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,260
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen !

246
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,763
A medal that will be so good

247
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,849
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

248
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,519
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

249
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,272
-Is he serious?
-Oh, please!

250
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,524
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

251
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,652
Of course he's not serious.

252
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,155
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

253
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,865
That's why I came
straight here, Tapper.

254
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,450
You've never given me a bum steer.

255
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,287
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

256
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,623
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

257
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,334
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be. . .

258
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,627
Tapper, I need a root beer.

259
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
Coming ! Hold that thought.

260
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,971
Okay. As you were saying.

261
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,099
I was saying,
I can't spend another 30 years

262
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,517
living alone in the garbage.

263
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,435
I'm not going back without a medal.

264
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,020
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

265
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,439
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

266
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,775
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

267
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,528
Okay, let's see what we got here.

268
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,822
Go on, get out of here.

269
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,784
Mushroom? No.

270
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,412
What is this? No.

271
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,457
Come on, Zangief! Gross.

272
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,169
What am I doing?

273
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,715
-Hey, excuse you !
-We are humanity's last hope.

274
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,551
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

275
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,887
We are humanity's last hope.

276
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,598
You okay there, space cadet?

277
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,475
We've only been plugged in a week

278
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,062
and every day it's,
"Climb the building, then fight bugs.

279
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,523
"Climb the building, fight more bugs!"

280
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,816
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

281
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,943
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

282
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,319
It's tough all over, all right?

283
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,239
And all for what? A lousy medal?

284
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,034
Medal? You win a medal?

285
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,910
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

286
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,912
Is it shiny?

287
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,664
Pretty shiny.

288
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,792
-And it says "hero" on it?
-Oh, yeah.

289
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,211
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

290
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,963
-And fighting bugs!
-Right, bugs.

291
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,591
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

292
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,843
and maybe get one of those medals?

293
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,762
-Negatory.
-Does that mean maybe?

294
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,056
No! Look, only the bravest

295
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,059
and the best serve in our corps.

296
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,185
Bug !

297
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,197
We are humanity's last hope.

298
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,456
Attention! The arcade will
open in five minutes.

299
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,458
Please report to your games.

300
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,171
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

301
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,716
Smells like Ralph in here.

302
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,804
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

303
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,764
Hero's something.

304
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,140
Duty. Hero's Duty.

305
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,433
There it is.

306
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,565
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

307
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,864
The wall.

308
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,041
Morning, kids. Come on in.

309
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,502
Good to see you.
Good to see you. You, too, little fella.

310
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,009
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

311
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,094
This is not a drill.

312
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,930
Ooh ! Sweet golden medal !

313
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,479
On a planet with no name

314
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,649
a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.

315
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,778
You are humanity's last hope.

316
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,283
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting !

317
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,784
All right.

318
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,787
Now listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

319
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,456
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

320
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,084
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

321
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,460
keep it to yourself.

322
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,963
It's make your mamas proud time!

323
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,298
I love my mama!

324
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,049
Heads up! First-person shooter,

325
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,217
coming through !

326
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,802
Ooh, robot!

327
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,224
Game play in three, two, one.

328
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,228
We are humanity's last hope.

329
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,313
Our mission?

330
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,232
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

331
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,568
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

332
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,697
Sweet Mother Hubbard !

333
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,287
No, no, no! Wait a second !

334
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,835
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

335
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,924
No, no! Wait, wait!

336
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,471
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

337
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,683
My gun ! Give me that back.

338
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,607
Shoot the eggs before they hatch !

339
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,733
Oh, no!

340
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,360
Something's coming out of their bottom !

341
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,364
-Oh, gross!
-Markowski!

342
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,032
Get back in formation!

343
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,992
All right, ladies,

344
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,620
the kitten whispers
and tickle fights stop now.

345
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,455
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

346
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,332
-I'll meet you guys inside!
-No!

347
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,584
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

348
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,381
I thought this was going
to be like Centipede!

349
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,592
When did video games
become so violent and scary?

350
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,970
Please, get me out of here!

351
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,597
Take her!

352
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,019
What a rip-off!

353
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,148
Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

354
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,861
Beacon up!

355
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,826
Cease fire! Cease fire!

356
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,334
Attention! Return to start positions.

357
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,169
Return to start positions.

358
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,549
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

359
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,509
Yeah, you must be upset.

360
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,428
-Markowski.
-Who?

361
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,431
Yeah, me. I'm Markowski.

362
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,142
What's the first rule of Hero's Duty?

363
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,769
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

364
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,898
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

365
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,818
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

366
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,487
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

367
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,614
So stick to the program, soldier!

368
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,699
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

369
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,409
Quarter alert! Quarter alert!

370
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,245
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

371
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,667
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.

372
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,671
So that's where they
keep the medal, huh?

373
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,511
"New racers daily."

374
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,722
Sweet! I got next game.

375
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,848
Go away, kid !

376
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,516
We're going to play
all nine of today's racers!

377
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,601
Yeah !

378
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,936
Sorry.

379
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,702
Where's the wrecking guy?

380
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,623
Where's Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.

381
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,792
Stick with the program.

382
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,044
Fix it, Felix!

383
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,388
Ralph ! Quarter alert! Game on !

384
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,481
Do something, Felix!

385
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,192
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

386
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,073
Ralph ! Ralph !

387
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,366
What the. . .

388
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,618
Ralph? Ralph !

389
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,748
Oh, my land ! Where is he?

390
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,167
Mr. Litwak!

391
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,794
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

392
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,254
The game's busted.

393
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,924
l can fix it! l can fix it!

394
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,050
Oh, boy.

395
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,137
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

396
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,973
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

397
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,391
But what about the game?

398
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,393
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow. . .

399
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,603
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

400
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,856
to put old Ralph and Felix
out to pasture.

401
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,190
Like my nana.

402
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,371
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of order.

403
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,249
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed !

404
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,251
They're going to pull our plug !

405
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,172
Okay, everybody, calm down.

406
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,258
Ralph probably fell asleep

407
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,885
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

408
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,470
See? There he is now.

409
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,021
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

410
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,357
What's he saying, Felix?

411
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,277
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

412
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,169
Ralph's gone Turbo!

413
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,769
Shiny.

414
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,564
Attention! The arcade is now closed.

415
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,066
Did you get a load of Markowski?

416
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,151
Shut your chew holes.

417
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,070
Cy-Bug.

418
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,414
Taste it!

419
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,507
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

420
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,175
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr. , ma'am.

421
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,803
From the game Fix-lt Felix, Jr.

422
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,223
Jiminey jaminey!

423
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,894
Look at that high definition. Your face!

424
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,397
It's amazing !

425
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,984
Flattery don't charge
these batteries, civilian.

426
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,402
Now, state your business.

427
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,405
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

428
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,198
Never heard of him.

429
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,575
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

430
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,204
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

431
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,374
That came from the tower.

432
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,437
Nice eggs. Nice eggs!

433
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,231
Okay. That was easy.

434
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,113
Congratulations, soldier.

435
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,407
lt is my honor to bestow upon you

436
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,576
the Medal of Heroes.

437
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,328
Wow!

438
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,802
No way!

439
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,970
Ten-hut!

440
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,681
Wow!

441
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,020
History will long revere
your courage and sacrifice.

442
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,229
Well, thank you !

443
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
You have etched in the rock of virtue

444
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,067
a legacy beyond compare.

445
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,694
Thanks, guys. At ease!

446
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,739
You are the universe's greatest hero.

447
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,329
The living embodiment of
all this corps represents.

448
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,959
Bravery. lntegrity.
Grace under pressure.

449
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,754
And above all, dignity.

450
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,881
Escape pod activated.

451
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,469
Get off my face!

452
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,684
Incoming !

453
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,691
-Ralph !
-Cy-Bug !

454
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,414
Oh, no!

455
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,914
Sayonara, sucker!

456
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,510
"Sugar Rush"?

457
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,768
Oh, no!

458
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,605
This is that candy go-cart game

459
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,189
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

460
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,900
I got to get out of here.

461
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,943
Oh, no! My medal !

462
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,699
No, no, no, no, my medal !

463
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,079
No, no, my medal !

464
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Hi, mister.

465
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,563
Hello.

466
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:58,277
Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.

467
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,987
What's your name?

468
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,739
Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph.

469
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,658
You're not from here, are you?

470
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,161
No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

471
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,537
I'm just doing some work here.

472
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,705
What kind of work?

473
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,874
Some routine candy tree trimming.

474
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,334
You probably want to stand back.

475
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,336
In fact, this whole area

476
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,796
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

477
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,839
-Who's "we"?
-Candy tree department.

478
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,758
Where is everybody else?

479
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,259
It's just me today.

480
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,720
So you just meant like the royal "we"?

481
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,847
Yep. That's right.

482
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,724
Hey, are you a hobo?

483
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,937
No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.

484
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,356
Okay? So you go home.

485
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,233
What's that? Didn't hear you.

486
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,527
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

487
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,778
Listen, I tried to be nice.

488
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,238
I tried to be nice.

489
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,865
-You're mimicking me.
-You're mimicking me!

490
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,826
-Okay.
-Okay.

491
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,412
That is rude,
and this conversation is over.

492
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,247
And this conversation is over.

493
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,209
I wouldn't grab that branch if I were you.

494
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,086
I'm from the candy tree department,
so I know what. . .

495
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,671
It's a double stripe.

496
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,884
Double stripes break.

497
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,470
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

498
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,432
I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying?

499
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,018
Why are you so freakishly. . .

500
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,562
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin !

501
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,230
Don't even think about it. That is mine.

502
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,732
-Race you for it!
-Hey!

503
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,526
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

504
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,611
-Double stripe!
-Come back here!

505
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,864
-The winner!
-Give it back! Give it!

506
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,952
Double stripe.

507
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,874
Thank you !

508
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,335
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

509
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,546
Okay. Here's the thing.

510
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,214
I'm not from the candy tree department.

511
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,093
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

512
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,180
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal !

513
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,640
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

514
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,225
It's precious to me.

515
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,187
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

516
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,481
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

517
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,483
-What the. . .
-See you, chump!

518
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,194
Come back! I'll find you !

519
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,029
I will find you !

520
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,155
Double stripe!

521
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,033
Nowhere to hide!

522
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,705
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

523
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,333
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

524
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
like a crazy person.

525
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,836
"Sugar Rush."

526
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,922
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

527
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,675
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

528
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,928
-What was that, now?
-What are you, thick?

529
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,138
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

530
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,266
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

531
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,227
I can't say that I do, ma'am.

532
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,312
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

533
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,897
They don't know they're in a game.

534
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,983
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

535
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,819
Without a beacon to stop them,

536
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,821
they'll consume Sugar Rush.

537
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,155
But do you think they'll stop there?

538
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,740
-Yes!
-Wrong !

539
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,701
Viruses do not stop!

540
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,412
Once those Cy-Bugs
finish off Sugar Rush,

541
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,582
they'll invade every other game
until this arcade

542
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:03,504
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

543
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,298
Kohut! My cruiser.

544
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,263
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

545
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,056
It's not her fault.

546
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,226
She's programmed with
the most tragic back-story ever.

547
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,645
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check. . .

548
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,940
Her wedding day.

549
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,666
Wait, ma'am ! I'm going with you.

550
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,668
Like fun you are, short stack.

551
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,254
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

552
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,007
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

553
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,051
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

554
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,887
And I cannot ask you

555
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,014
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

556
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,143
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

557
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,934
Citizens of Sugar Rush...

558
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,810
Just in time.

559
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,441
...all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.

560
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,819
Hello, my royal subjects!

561
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,280
Have some candy!

562
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:59,119
Thank you for that
stirring introduction, Sour Bill.

563
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,040
And thank you to today's avatars.

564
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,085
lt was a wonderful day of racing. lt was.

565
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,878
But now the arcade is closed,

566
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,214
so it's time to wipe the slate clean

567
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,800
and race to decide our new roster.

568
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,303
The first nine racers
across that finish line

569
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,059
will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatars!

570
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,519
Race! Race! Race!

571
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay, calm down.

572
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,984
Listen! This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.

573
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,653
The fee to compete is one gold coin

574
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,780
from your previous winnings,

575
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,616
if you've ever won, which l have.

576
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,535
Let me go first!

577
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,625
King Candy!

578
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,010
Taffyta Muttonfudge!

579
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,177
Stay sweet!

580
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,848
Adorabeezle Winterpop.

581
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,434
Gloyd Orangeboar!

582
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:09,189
Little stealer! Wait till I catch that brat.

583
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,526
Minty Zaki. Snowanna Rainbeau.

584
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,447
Rancis Fluggerbutter.
Jubileena Bing-Bing.

585
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,241
Swizzle Malarkey.

586
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,744
Candlehead.

587
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,587
Sour Bill, who's that last one?

588
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,342
Vanellope von Schweetz!

589
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,595
Yippee! I'm in the race!

590
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,763
Vanellope?

591
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,640
The Glitch !

592
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,436
Now, now!

593
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,023
Everything is all right! Security!

594
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,357
Come here, kid !

595
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,860
We're not going to hurt you,
you little freak!

596
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,322
Get back here!

597
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,615
Slow down ! Slow down a little bit.

598
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,539
You ! Give me back my medal right now!

599
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,124
-Ah, boy!
-Go!

600
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,709
What is that?

601
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,628
Come on ! Go! Roll !

602
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,392
Careful! What are you doing?

603
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,320
Come back here!

604
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,032
I can't move!

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,659
Now we got him !

606
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,411
Oh, good, the cops. She went that way!

607
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,038
-Hold still !
-Take that!

608
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,164
What are you doing?

609
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,707
Okay, folks.

610
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,669
Calm down! Everything's all right.

611
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,879
The monster's been caught!

612
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,965
We'll repair all the damage.

613
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,802
Don't worry. We will have our race
before the arcade opens.

614
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,597
And I'm in it. Yes!

615
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,896
There's no way that
I am racing with a glitch.

616
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,815
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

617
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,611
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race!

618
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,905
And bring that thing to my castle.

619
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,740
Guys! She took. . .

620
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,541
Or-e-oh
Oreo!

621
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,668
Or-e-oh

622
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,974
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

623
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,809
so we can see
what we're up against here.

624
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,060
Mm-kay.

625
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,982
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

626
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,068
Yeah. Who are you,
the guy that makes the donuts?

627
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,196
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

628
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,699
I see you're a fan of pink.

629
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,035
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously. . .

630
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,745
What are you doing here?

631
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:14,041
Look, Your Candiness,
this is just a big misunderstanding.

632
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,751
Just get me out of this cupcake,

633
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,878
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

634
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,757
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.

635
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,383
Well, this one did.

636
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,385
I earned it over in Hero's Duty.

637
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,511
You game-jumped?

638
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,222
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

639
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,682
What? No, no.

640
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,311
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

641
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,855
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming !

642
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,649
Easy, Your Puffiness.

643
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,359
It's not my fault one of your children

644
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,277
of the candy corn stole my medal.

645
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,613
"Children of the candy corn"? Who'd. . .

646
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,365
The Glitch !

647
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,825
The coin she used to
buy her way into the race.

648
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,952
That was your medal?

649
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,287
She did what? I need that back!

650
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,165
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

651
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,709
It's nothing but code now.

652
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,837
It will stay that way
until someone wins the cup

653
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,255
at the end of the race.

654
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,633
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

655
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,842
with the winner then.

656
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,803
Is that a threat I smell?

657
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,516
Beyond the halitosis
you so obviously suffer from.

658
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,061
Listen, Nilly-Wafer,
I'm not leaving without my medal !

659
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,646
Yes, you are.

660
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,649
Wynnchel, Duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

661
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,526
and on the first train back home.

662
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,945
If I ever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

663
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

664
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,865
Fungeon?

665
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,702
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

666
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,412
It's the. . .

667
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,916
Never mind ! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

668
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,795
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph !
It hasn't been a pleasure.

669
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,426
This thing is hard as a rock.

670
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,552
I can see that.

671
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,053
-Get the tools.
-What tools?

672
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,638
Quiet, you !

673
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,725
What? No!

674
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,518
-Take it easy, big boy!
-Stay away from me!

675
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,686
He's getting away!

676
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,152
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

677
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,378
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

678
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,174
I got to get my medal back.

679
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,805
The pot goes to the winning racer!

680
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,016
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

681
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,528
Hello, fellow racers!

682
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,573
It's that little crumb snatcher.

683
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,367
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

684
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,037
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

685
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,040
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

686
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,209
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

687
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,543
I built it myself.

688
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,254
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

689
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,506
Check her out.

690
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,223
Vanellope, it's so. . . You.

691
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,268
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

692
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,978
No, I don't,

693
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,856
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board. . .

694
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,109
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

695
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,112
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

696
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,698
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

697
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,742
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

698
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,703
To protect us. Say I'm you.

699
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,540
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

700
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,209
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

701
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,294
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

702
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm glitching !

703
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,340
-Hey!
-See?

704
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,467
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

705
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,554
Oh, no! I glitched, too!

706
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,931
Uncool.

707
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,767
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

708
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,311
Please!

709
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,730
I just want to race like you guys.

710
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,276
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

711
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,444
And that's all you'll ever be!

712
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,115
Hey! Leave her alone!

713
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,787
Let's get out of here!

714
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,502
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

715
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,129
Before I throw you in the mud !

716
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,345
What are you looking at?

717
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,932
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

718
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,311
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

719
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,063
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

720
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,482
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

721
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,526
Coin, medal, whatever.

722
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,321
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

723
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,740
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

724
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,491
I won it in Hero's Duty.

725
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,660
Hero's Doodie?

726
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,706
It's not that kind of duty.

727
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,875
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

728
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,211
in a game called Hero's Doodie!

729
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,881
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

730
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,510
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

731
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,012
-Listen !
-One more, one more.

732
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,514
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

733
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,684
-Say "why."
-Why?

734
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,853
Because it was his doodie!

735
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,772
How dare you insult Hero's Duty?

736
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,981
You little guttersnipe!

737
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,566
I earned that medal

738
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,027
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

739
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,946
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

740
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,822
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

741
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,324
I can't help you !

742
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,415
What a moron.

743
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,335
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

744
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,878
You're never going to break. . .

745
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,553
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

746
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,888
Leave me alone.

747
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,226
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

748
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,061
So here's what I'm thinking.

749
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,439
You help me get a new cart. . .
A real cart. . .

750
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,567
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

751
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,279
You want me to help you?

752
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,739
All you got to do is
break something for me.

753
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,575
Come on. What do you say, friend?

754
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,286
We are not friends.

755
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,456
Come on, pal. You son of a gun.

756
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,959
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

757
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,461
Come on, chumbo.

758
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,047
Ralph, my man. My main man.

759
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,716
Hey!

760
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,136
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

761
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,723
You better win.

762
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,227
Well, I'll say this much,

763
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,771
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

764
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,524
There's the shuttle.

765
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,237
Is he in there?

766
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,282
Nope. Lucky for him.

767
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,951
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

768
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,620
No Cy-Bug, either.

769
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,416
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

770
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,002
It came this way,

771
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,754
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

772
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,297

773
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,798
Can't get a read on it.

774
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,217
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

775
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,469
Why did he go AWOL?

776
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,095
I wish I knew, ma'am.

777
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,931
He was acting all squirrelly last night. . .

778
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,642
Going on about cake and medals. . .

779
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,687
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

780
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,022
"Go Turbo"?

781
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,941
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

782
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,487
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

783
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,406
Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.

784
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,950
-And Turbo...
-Turbo-tastic!

785
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,661
-He loved the attention.
-Turbo-tastic!

786
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,706
So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in

787
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,249
and stole Turbo's thunder...

788
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,834
New game. All right!

789
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,836
Boy, was he jealous.

790
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,341
So jealous that
he abandoned his game

791
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,009
and tried to take over the new one.

792
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,303
These are the greatest graphics
I've ever seen !

793
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,513
Turbo-tastic!

794
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,350
Hey. Is that. . . That looks like Turbo.

795
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,478
What's Turbo doing in this game?
Aw, come on !

796
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,063
Mr. Litwak!

797
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,818
Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself

798
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,196
out of order, for good.

799
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,408
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

800
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,410
chasing a cautionary tale.

801
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,911
I know, right?

802
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,622
That's why I have to get Ralph home

803
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,874
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

804
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,005
What is this?

805
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,467
-"Nesquik Sand"?
-Quicksand?

806
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,387
I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

807
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:56,271
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

808
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,522
We're going to drown here.

809
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,107
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

810
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,275
You're making us sink faster.

811
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,359
We're going to die!

812
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,944
Get ahold of yourself!

813
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,868
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

814
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,370
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

815
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,913
Here, hit me again.

816
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,253
That's not funny enough. Harder!

817
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,963
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't. . .

818
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,757
No, ma'am !
The arcade is depending on us.

819
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,594
Now do your duty. That's an ord. . .

820
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,098
It's working ! Hit me again.

821
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,058
Your eye.

822
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,103
I can fix it. Now. . .

823
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,107
San Fran-tastic! Again !

824
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,443
You mean business!

825
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,446
Yikes on bikes!

826
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,242
Wow! We're. . . killing. . . them !

827
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,620
Comedy gold !

828
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,481
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

829
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,233
We've got work to do. Let's go.

830
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,654
We lost the Cy-Bug.

831
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,572
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

832
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,324
You think you can fix that shuttle?

833
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,451
Can do.

834
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,603
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open !

835
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,606
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

836
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,525
Hey, we shook on it.

837
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,989
Thank you, Jeeves.

838
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,201
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

839
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,452
You gotta make one.

840
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,704
What? No, no.

841
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,706
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

842
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,874
I don't make things. I break things.

843
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,043
Well, it looks like
you're going to be stepping outside

844
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,545
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

845
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,338
This is a good one!

846
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,467
Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!

847
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,136
What is this, another game?

848
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,470
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.

849
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,180
You have one minute to win it.

850
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,640
-What?
-Come on, Ralph !

851
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,559
Go! Mixing.

852
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,311
Put the ingredients in the bowl

853
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,854
and throw away the trash.

854
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,188
Hairbrush. No!

855
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,316
Underpants. No, no!

856
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,900
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

857
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,694
I'm trying !

858
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,072
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

859
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,908
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes.

860
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,202
Batter up!

861
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,752
Come on ! No sleeping on the job!

862
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,671
Baking! Pump up the heat

863
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,715
and hold the perfect temperature.

864
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,383
Ralph, a little help here?

865
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,509
I'm on it.

866
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,431
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

867
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,517
Okay, good. Little more.

868
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,771
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

869
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,109
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph !
Fifteen seconds!

870
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,861
-Decorating!
-Wheels first.

871
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,279
-How many?
-Four, doy!

872
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,447
Got it.

873
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,034
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting !

874
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,118
No problem.

875
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,467
Time's up! Congratulations.

876
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,512
You did it, and here's your cart!

877
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:11,734
Look, kid. . . I tried to warn you.

878
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,821
I can't make things. I just break. . .

879
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,406
I love it.

880
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,990
You do?

881
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,659
I love it.

882
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,828
I love it! I love it! I love it!

883
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,663
Look, it's got a real engine!

884
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,665
And look at these wheels.

885
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,836
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

886
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,507
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

887
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,136
Cream puffs.

888
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,186
This is Beard Papa.

889
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,022
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

890
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,280
What? You have teeth?

891
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,699
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

892
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:03,661
I'm not smiling. I was. . . I'm gassy, okay?

893
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,708
Hold it right there, Glitch !

894
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,877
And Wreck-It Ralph?

895
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,006
Start the cart! Start the cart!

896
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,341
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

897
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,929
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

898
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,389
You don't what?

899
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,891
Are you hurt, Sire?

900
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,227
No, he just glazed me. Get them !

901
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,104
Gangway!

902
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,195
Stop, in the name of the king !
That's me!

903
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,242
Get off the road !

904
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,458
Head for Diet Cola Mountain !

905
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,172
-Drive into the wall !
-What?

906
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,008
Right there, between
the two sugar-free lollipops!

907
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,260
-Are you crazy?
-Just do it!

908
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,692
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

909
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,405
Find that glitch ! Destroy that cart!

910
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,866
She can't be allowed to race!

911
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:32,541
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

912
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,418
Well, no, not technically.

913
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,254
-I just thought that. . .
-What did you think?

914
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,423
"I'll just magically win the race

915
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,967
"just because I really want to!"

916
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,427
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

917
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,471
I can feel it in my code.

918
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,059
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

919
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,729
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

920
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:54,855
The big whoop?

921
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,316
Well, this may come as
a shock to you, but in my game,

922
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,735
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

923
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,862
-Cool.
-No. Not cool.

924
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,782
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

925
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,203
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

926
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,247
I go home with that baby
around my neck

927
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,332
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

928
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,960
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

929
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,172
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

930
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,841
No, I get it!

931
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,176
That's exactly
what racing would do for me!

932
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,678
-Well, guess what?
-What?

933
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,806
News flash ! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

934
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,436
What was that?

935
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,662
Yeah ! Check it out. Look!

936
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,505
You got to watch out for the splash.

937
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,341
That stuff is broiling hot.

938
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,967
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

939
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,386
What is this dump?

940
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,182
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

941
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,225
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

942
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,812
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

943
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,606
See? Look, look, look.

944
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,609
Welcome to my home!

945
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,195
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

946
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,281
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

947
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,784
By yourself?

948
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,745
With all this garbage around you?

949
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,790
Well, yeah.

950
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,042
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

951
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,169
and that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

952
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,837
What do you expect?

953
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,382
Listen, kid. . .

954
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,801
I know it's none of my business

955
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,595
but why do you even
stick around this game?

956
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,847
You really don't know anything, do you?

957
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,225
Glitches can't leave their games.

958
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,021
It's one of the joys of being me.

959
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,407
Hey, what are you doing? Come on !

960
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,576
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

961
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,036
If you're going to be a racer,

962
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,496
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

963
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,666
And you can't do that without a track.

964
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,965
All right, now.

965
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,716
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

966
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,344
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

967
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,762
Wait. Do you know how to drive?

968
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,931
Yeah ! I mean, I haven't done it, but. . .

969
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,641
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

970
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,767
You crashed it.

971
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,478
Just get in. How hard can it be? Okay. . .

972
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,313
Start it up.

973
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,194
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

974
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,113
-Pedals.
-Pedals. Right.

975
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:53,868
Now, that's the go pedal.

976
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,997
That I believe is the stopper.

977
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,000
And this. . . Wait.

978
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,586
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

979
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,296
What does this joystick do?

980
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,008
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

981
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,372
Now shift it.

982
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,502
That's good. Keep going ! Shift it again !

983
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,843
I told you, racing's in my code!

984
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,389
I got that medal in the bag !

985
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,642
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

986
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,157
Look out!

987
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,585
Hot cola!

988
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,092
So how did I do?

989
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,679
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

990
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,431
Right, right. That's a good note.

991
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,684
You got to get that
glitch under control, kid.

992
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,227
Okay, I will, I will.

993
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,146
And then you think I got a chance?

994
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,025
Tiny.

995
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,860
Yes, I'm going to win !

996
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,904
I'm going to win ! I'm going to win !

997
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,864
-Top shelf.
-Top shelf.

998
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,421
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.

999
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,424
You didn't?

1000
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,970
Go. Leave me.

1001
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,826
Up, up, down, down. . .

1002
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,663
Start!

1003
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,670
The code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1004
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:02,348
Where are you? Let's see. . .
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1005
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,310
There it is. The winner's cup.

1006
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,774
One of these things is
not like the others. . . It's you !

1007
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,693
We're going to give you
a nice new home.

1008
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,748
Success!

1009
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,502
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1010
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,004
You're in charge of the castle
until I get back.

1011
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,975
Your face is still red.

1012
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,977
You might want to
hit it again with your hammer.

1013
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,730
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1014
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,608
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1015
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,443
Okay.

1016
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,863
Ma'am, I just got to tell you. . .

1017
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,574
You are one dynamite gal.

1018
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,622
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1019
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,250
One dynamite gal.

1020
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,461
Dynamite gal.

1021
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,921
Dynamite. . .

1022
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,678
Get out.

1023
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,638
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1024
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,265
I said get out!

1025
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,817
Jiminey jaminey.

1026
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,658
Yes?

1027
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:50,664
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr. , sir,
from the game Fix-lt Felix Jr.

1028
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,416
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1029
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,959
Wreck-It Ralph?

1030
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,753
Yes. Yes, that's him !

1031
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,922
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1032
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,257
Locked him up?

1033
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,218
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1034
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,641
Hurry, hurry! Let's go. Time's a-wastin'.

1035
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,851
Come on, Ralph !

1036
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,895
This is it. This is really happening.

1037
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,271
I almost don't believe it.

1038
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,316
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now. . .

1039
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,568
And now. . . Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1040
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,028
I mean, I think I might puke.

1041
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,696
-You know, like a "vurp."
-A what?

1042
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,531
Vomit and a burp together,

1043
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,950
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1044
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,368
This is so exciting !

1045
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,245
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1046
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,456
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1047
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,666
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1048
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,170
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1049
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,632
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1050
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,384
-Because you're a winner.
-I'm a winner.

1051
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,304
-And you're adorable!
-I'm adorable!

1052
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,014
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1053
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,557
Yeah !

1054
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,851
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1055
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,979
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1056
01:02:56,064 --> 01:03:00,234
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1057
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,694
-And have fun. Got it?
-Got it.

1058
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,531
Oh, wait!

1059
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,158
Hold on !

1060
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,243
Where are you going?

1061
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,245
I forgot something ! I'll be right back!

1062
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,832
Kids.

1063
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,503
Ralph ! There you are. Hello!

1064
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,840
-You !
-I come alone, unarmed.

1065
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,384
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1066
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,386
Please. Calm down ! Please, look. Don't!

1067
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,264
I'm going to beat the filling out of you !

1068
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,392
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1069
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,895
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's. . . Well played.

1070
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,314
What do you want, Candy?

1071
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,899
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1072
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,944
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1073
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,031
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1074
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,075
My medal. How did you. . .

1075
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,912
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1076
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,835
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1077
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,378
About what?

1078
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,423
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1079
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,091
about being a king is?

1080
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,886
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1081
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,137
Get to the point.

1082
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,431
Point being, I need your help.

1083
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:17,144
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1084
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,313
Why are you people so against her?

1085
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,566
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1086
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,443
If Vanellope wins that race

1087
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,613
she'll be added to the race roster.

1088
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,158
Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.

1089
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,036
And when they see her glitching

1090
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,830
and twitching and just being herself,

1091
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,749
they'll think our game is broken.

1092
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
We'll be put out of order for good.

1093
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,797
All my subjects will be homeless.

1094
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,803
But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.

1095
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,514
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1096
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,059
And when the game's plug is pulled...

1097
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,477
No!

1098
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,897
. . .she'll die with it.

1099
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,067
You don't know that will happen.

1100
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,401
The gamers could love her.

1101
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,612
And if they don't?

1102
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,913
I know it's tough,

1103
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,208
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1104
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:27,005
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1105
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,509
So can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1106
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,429
Very good.

1107
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,016
I'll give you two some time alone.

1108
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,544
I'm back!

1109
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,921
Did you miss me?

1110
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,092
Yeah. . . Can we talk for a second?

1111
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,261
Wait. First, kneel down.

1112
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,680
-What? No, we really. . .
-Will you just do it?

1113
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,557
Okay.

1114
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,727
-Now, close your eyes.
-Vanellope. . .

1115
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,146
Shush ! Close them !

1116
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,317
Okay. Open them up.

1117
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,115
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1118
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,283
Turn it over.

1119
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,162
I made it for you.

1120
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,330
Just in case we don't win.

1121
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,791
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1122
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:45,917
we're not going to win.

1123
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,712
Thanks, kid. Listen. . .

1124
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:53,717
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1125
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,803
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1126
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,807
-I've been thinking.
-That's dangerous.

1127
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,060
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway? Right?

1128
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,605
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1129
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,773
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1130
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,983
to build the car and everything. . .

1131
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,153
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1132
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,780
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1133
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,449
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1134
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,451
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1135
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:20,785
What?

1136
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,497
Why would you. . .

1137
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,374
Wait a minute.

1138
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:27,959
No!

1139
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,127
Where did you get this?

1140
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,214
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1141
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,798
I've been talking to King Candy.

1142
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,425
-King Candy?
-Yeah.

1143
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,801
You sold me out?

1144
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,678
No, I didn't. . . Listen.
You don't understand.

1145
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,056
No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

1146
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,432
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1147
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,850
You're a rat!

1148
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,395
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1149
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,231
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid !

1150
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,066
Put me down ! Let me go!

1151
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,317
No, you listen to me.

1152
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,401
Do you know what's going to happen

1153
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,486
when the players see you glitching?

1154
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,820
They'll think the game's broken.

1155
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,322
I don't care! You're a liar!

1156
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,908
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1157
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:00,992
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1158
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,118
I'm not listening to you !

1159
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,996
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1160
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,414
No, you're not!

1161
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,044
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1162
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,380
No. I'm doing this for your own good !

1163
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:16,883
Wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,760
No. No.

1165
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,762
No, no, no, no, no!

1166
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,013
Please, Ralph !

1167
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,098
No!

1168
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,394
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1169
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:57,757
You really are a bad guy.

1170
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,701
Hello? Anybody home?

1171
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,454
Felix? Mary?

1172
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,415
Well, you actually went and did it.

1173
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:33,251
Gene. Where is everybody?

1174
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,003
They're gone.

1175
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,590
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back. . .

1176
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,009
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1177
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,136
But I'm here now.

1178
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,138
It's too late, Ralph.

1179
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,599
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1180
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,947
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1181
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,950
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1182
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,164
Gene, wait! Wait!

1183
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:15,043
Listen, this is not what I wanted !

1184
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,170
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1185
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,631
I don't know. I just. . .

1186
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,637
I was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1187
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:46,407
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1188
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,042
Hey, cough drop.

1189
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,378
Explain something to me.

1190
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,714
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1191
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,592
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1192
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,306
What's going on

1193
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,807
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1194
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:53,933
Nothing.

1195
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,059
-Talk!
-No.

1196
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,728
-I'll lick you.
-You wouldn't.

1197
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,605
Oh, yeah?

1198
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,190
That's like sandpaper!

1199
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,901
Wonder how many licks it will take

1200
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,319
to get to your center.

1201
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,904
I'll take it to my grave!

1202
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,238
Fair enough.

1203
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,911
They call you Sour Bill for a reason.

1204
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,248
-Had enough yet?
-Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1205
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,958
Vanellope was a racer

1206
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,502
until King Candy
tried to delete her code!

1207
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,671
Tried to delete her code?

1208
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,758
So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?

1209
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,134
I don't know!

1210
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,385
Suit yourself.

1211
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,429
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1212
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,307
He literally locked up our memories

1213
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,600
and l cannot remember!

1214
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:36,976
Nobody can!

1215
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,811
But I do know this.

1216
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,772
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1217
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,358
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1218
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:46,277
the game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1219
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,612
Where is she now?

1220
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,030
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1221
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:50,281
Felix?

1222
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,158
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1223
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:56,454
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again !

1224
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,916
Stick around.

1225
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,169
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you !

1226
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,967
Come on. I know you're out there.

1227
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,804
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1228
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,184
But. . . Where?

1229
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:39,455
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1230
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,501
Hello? Hello?

1231
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,880
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1232
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,050
What's he say?

1233
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,511
I'm gonna wreck it!

1234
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,351
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1235
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,232
-Felix!
-Ralph !

1236
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,526
I'm so glad to see you !

1237
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,238
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1238
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,366
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you !

1239
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,201
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1240
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,287
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1241
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,540
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1242
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,585
I'm just so, so cross with you !

1243
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,879
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1244
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,382
I ran higgledy-piggledy
all over creation looking for you.

1245
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,468
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1246
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,388
And then. . . I met the most dynamite gal.

1247
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:41,142
She gives me the honey glow
something awful.

1248
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,520
But she rebuffed my affections.

1249
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,773
And then I got thrown in jail !

1250
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,399
Felix, pull yourself together.

1251
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:52,278
No! You don't know
what it's like to be rejected

1252
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,072
and treated like a criminal !

1253
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,824
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1254
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,910
It is?

1255
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,914
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1256
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,792
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1257
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,211
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1258
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:10,296
Please, Felix, fix it.

1259
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,883
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1260
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,784
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1261
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,412
-And?
-And a real numskull.

1262
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,332
-And?
-A selfish diaper baby.

1263
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,542
And?

1264
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,460
And. . .

1265
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,671
A stinkbrain?

1266
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,757
The stinkiest brain ever.

1267
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,573
My sweet subjects,

1268
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,493
l can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you

1269
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,621
that l have never been
so happy in all my life

1270
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,999
to say the following words,

1271
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,419
let the Random Roster Race
commence!

1272
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:51,522
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1273
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,191
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1274
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,360
I'm already a real racer.

1275
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,197
And I'm going to win.

1276
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:42,823
Have some candy.

1277
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:02,426
Behind you !

1278
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:04,762
In front of you !

1279
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,606
-It's The Glitch !
-The Glitch?

1280
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,233
Light them up, Candlehead.

1281
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:23,531
What's this? Cherry bombs!

1282
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:33,791
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1283
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,810
My candle!

1284
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,522
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1285
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:58,149
No more glitching.

1286
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,277
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1287
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:02,820
without any more surprises.

1288
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,115
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1289
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:09,285
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1290
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,911
My lady, you came back.

1291
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,371
Can it, Fix-It!

1292
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,166
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1293
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,210
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I. . .

1294
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,840
Bullroar.

1295
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:33,434
Listen up, people. Head to
Game Central Station now!

1296
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,478
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1297
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,313
Go! Go! Go!

1298
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,655
No!

1299
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,907
Get off of my track!

1300
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,242
Hey!

1301
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,743
What, are you crazy!

1302
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,624
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1303
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,460
Knock it off!

1304
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,506
Ralph, look!

1305
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:47,258
Kid !

1306
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,345
Stop it!

1307
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,431
I'm not letting you
undo all my hard work!

1308
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,102
Is that. . .

1309
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,773
No way!

1310
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,818
What the. . . Who are you?

1311
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:10,197
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1312
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,950
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1313
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,203
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1314
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,038
take it away from me!

1315
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:20,666
Turbo-tastic.

1316
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,211
End of the line, Glitch !

1317
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,381
Glitch. That's it.

1318
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,341
Come on, Vanellope.

1319
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,135
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1320
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,304
but you're going to do it one more time.

1321
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:35,556
Just focus and concentrate

1322
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:38,809
and glitch !

1323
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,983
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1324
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,069
No!

1325
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,579
Bring it home, kid !
The finish line is wide open !

1326
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,845
No!

1327
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,640
Kid ! Are you okay?

1328
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:21,185
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1329
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,439
Oh, my land.

1330
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,274
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1331
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,443
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1332
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,362
There is no finish line!

1333
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,698
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1334
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,535
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1335
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,703
We got to try!

1336
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:43,874
Kid !

1337
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,377
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1338
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,129
-Come on. Get through.
-Ralph ! Stop!

1339
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,632
It's got to work!

1340
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,801
Stop, it's no use.

1341
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,435
It's okay, Ralph.

1342
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:06,730
All right, Fix-It.

1343
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,566
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1344
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,238
Just go. Go without me.

1345
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,033
-But what about this game?
-Nothing we can do about it.

1346
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,662
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1347
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,916
Beacon?

1348
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,711
Stay with Felix.

1349
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,170
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1350
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,424
-Ralph ! Where are you going?
-I got some wrecking to do!

1351
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,384
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1352
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:36,510
No! Wait!

1353
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,012
Fix-It, get behind me!

1354
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,069
Come on !

1355
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,367
One more! One. . .

1356
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:04,580
Welcome to the boss level !

1357
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:05,914
Turbo.

1358
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,917
Because of you, Ralph,

1359
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:13,213
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1360
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,716
I can take over any game I want.

1361
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,593
I should thank you

1362
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,429
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1363
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,475
Get back here, little guy!

1364
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,648
Have some candy!

1365
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,818
Where do you think you're going?

1366
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:42,618
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1367
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:43,911
No!

1368
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,538
Ralph !

1369
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,668
Fall back.

1370
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:54,671
Kid !

1371
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,762
Vanellope!

1372
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,640
Look at that. It's your little friend.

1373
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,768
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1374
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,103
No!

1375
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,941
It's game over for both of you.

1376
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,361
No. Just for me!

1377
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:21,156
-Ralph !
-Vanellope!

1378
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,915
I'm bad, and that's good.

1379
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,210
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1380
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,132
There's no one I'd rather be. . .

1381
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,635
. . .than me.

1382
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:10,747
Kid !

1383
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:14,042
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1384
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:42,070
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh. . .

1385
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,326
No! No, no, no. Yes. . .

1386
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,287
No! Yes. . . No!

1387
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,707
Go into the light!

1388
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:02,507
Chocolate?

1389
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,219
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1390
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,014
Oh, beautiful chocolate!

1391
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,140
Yeah !

1392
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,645
You did it, Ralph ! Way to go, brother!

1393
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,486
I. . . Excuse. . .

1394
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:30,953
All fixed.

1395
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:34,206
-You ready for this?
-As ready as I'll ever be.

1396
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,717
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1397
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,206
Princess Vanellope?

1398
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,333
Now I remember.

1399
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,755
All hail the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush...

1400
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,549
Princess Vanellope.

1401
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:28,510
I remember. She's our princess!

1402
01:28:28,594 --> 01:28:29,886
Oh, that's right!

1403
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,805
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1404
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,390
Yeah, those were jokes!

1405
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,309
I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to do!

1406
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,228
Tut-tut.

1407
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,898
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1408
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:46,486
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1409
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:47,946
executed.

1410
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:50,490
What? No, please!

1411
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:51,867
Oh, my land.

1412
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:54,244
This place just got interesting.

1413
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:56,580
I don't want to die!

1414
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,250
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1415
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,252
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1416
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,921
Wow.

1417
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,175
So this is the real you. Princess.

1418
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:12,262
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1419
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,849
This is me.

1420
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,102
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1421
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,812
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1422
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,024
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1423
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,609
I was here, I was there.

1424
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,611
I was glitching through the walls.

1425
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:28,737
I'm not giving that up.

1426
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:30,947
Pardon me for asking,

1427
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,201
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1428
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:35,327
Yeah. Who?

1429
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:39,206
Me. I'm thinking more along the lines of

1430
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,458
a constitutional democracy.

1431
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:45,003
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1432
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,797
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1433
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:50,717
Fix-It, Wreck-It,
the arcade's about to open.

1434
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:52,719
Let's move 'em out.

1435
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,979
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1436
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:04,356
You'd have your own wing

1437
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,191
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1438
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,318
or treat you bad ever again.

1439
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,362
You could be happy.

1440
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,532
I'm already happy.

1441
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,534
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1442
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,662
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1443
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:22,457
It may not be as fancy
as being president

1444
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:23,875
but it's my duty.

1445
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,585
And it's a big duty!

1446
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,797
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1447
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,009
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1448
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:36,138
Au revoir, Admiral Underpants.

1449
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,516
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1450
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,935
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1451
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,396
-Hasta la vista, you...
-Ralph !

1452
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,940
-All right. To be continued.
-Yeah !

1453
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,733
Hooray!

1454
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,289
l'm gonna wreck it!

1455
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,377
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1456
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,088
The gang's all here!

1457
01:31:10,172 --> 01:31:14,426
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1458
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:16,177
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1459
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,555
All right! Yeah, Ralph !

1460
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,181
Of course, the job hasn't changed.

1461
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:24,936
But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!

1462
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:29,357
And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.

1463
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:31,943
-So here's what we did.
-We're gonna wreck it!

1464
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,321
We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.

1465
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,448
We can fix it!

1466
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,158
l'm telling you, guys,

1467
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,076
we haven't been this popular in years.

1468
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:41,453
-lt's crazy.
-Wow!

1469
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,039
The gamers say we're "retro,"

1470
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:47,000
which l think means "old but cool."

1471
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:48,585
How come we never noticed this game?

1472
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,545
And l decided that living in the dump

1473
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,255
wasn't making me feel very good,

1474
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:54,925
so l cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack

1475
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,676
and a couple for the new guys, too.

1476
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:01,097
Well, with a little help from Felix.

1477
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,558
And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.

1478
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:06,853
That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.

1479
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,522
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.

1480
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,066
Lot of grandeur.

1481
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,609
And not a single bug.

1482
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:20,033
Let's just say, some tears were shed.

1483
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:25,288
But l got to say, the best part of my day

1484
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:27,207
is when l get thrown off the roof.

1485
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,835
Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,

1486
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,381
l get a perfect view of Sugar Rush.

1487
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,466
And l can see Vanellope racing.

1488
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:40,303
Yes!

1489
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:42,681
The kid's a natural.

1490
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,809
And the players love her, glitch and all.

1491
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:47,978
Just like l knew they would.

1492
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:52,691
Turns out l don't need a medal
to tell me l'm a good guy.

1493
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,486
'Cause if that little kid likes me...

1494
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:01,574
How bad can l be?

1495
