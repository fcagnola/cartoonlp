2
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,729
Some things start out big...

3
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,567
and some things start out small.

4
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,902
Very small.

5
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,572
But sometimes the smallest thing...

6
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,700
can make the biggest changes of all.

7
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,446
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

8
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,201
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!

9
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,622
Plio, be careful.

10
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,414
Dad, get over here.

11
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:23,504
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go when stuff's happening.

12
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,932
- Well, what is it?
- It was an egg.

13
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,018
Look!

14
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,938
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea.

15
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,857
Vicious, flesh-eating.

16
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:48,529
- Looks like a baby to me.
- Babies grow up.

17
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,741
You keep that thing,
one day we'll turn our backs...

18
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:55,286
It'll be picking us out of its teeth.

19
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,874
Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

20
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,461
- So, what do we do?
- Get rid of it!

21
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,385
What has gotten into you?

22
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:15,222
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

23
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,727
I'm sorry, little one.

24
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,646
Okay, get rid of it.

25
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,859
All right, I will.

26
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,666
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

27
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,029
Here.

28
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,118
It's okay.
We'll teach him to hate meat.

29
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,791
Watch his head.

30
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,128
I-I mean, watch it.
He could bite.

31
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,972
This monster's got no teeth.
What's he gonna do, gum us to death?

32
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:43,269
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

33
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:47,064
Does that look like a monster to you?

34
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,022
Let me out! Let me out!

35
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,652
Hair ball!

36
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,697
That was great! Get him!

37
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,117
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

38
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,453
I can't take it!
There are too many of you!

39
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,872
Come on! Pick on somebody
your own size. Stop!

40
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,876
Help! All right, get up, get up, get up!
Hold it! I... No, stop it! Stop it!

41
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,380
Oh, no...

42
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,222
Aladar? You're not dead.

43
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:05,976
- No!
- All right, guys, break it up.

44
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,147
Remember the courtship? You're
gonna miss seeing all that smooching.

45
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,233
- Oh!
- Oh, Mom!

46
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,152
That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here!

47
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,534
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

48
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,081
Go find Zini.
He's rehearsing pickup lines.

49
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,416
Let's hope he's found
some new material.

50
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,879
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

51
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,883
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

52
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,762
Girls, I'm known
as the professor of love...

53
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,265
and school's in session!

54
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,475
Yeah, I still got it.

55
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,644
I hope it's not contagious.

56
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,355
I'm a raging epidemic of romance.

57
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,859
Come on, hot stuff. Let's get going. You
don't wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk.

58
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,405
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear
the mating advice of an old monkey.

59
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,866
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I heard that in his day that old monkey was quite a swinger.

60
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,785
- You talking about Yar?
- Yeah.

61
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,205
- To hear him tell it, he put the prime in primate.
- Really?

62
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,458
Okay, boys, gather 'round.

63
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,086
Listen and learn from the master.

64
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,463
Now, girls,
don't jump into the trees...

65
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,300
after the first boy
with a cute back flip.

66
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,885
It's more fun
if you keep them guessing.

67
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,222
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

68
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,893
You're never going to forget this day,
so make it one to remember.

69
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:34,398
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

70
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,860
Come on, guys.
We don't wanna let 'em down.

71
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,905
- Go on, now! Chest out, chin up!
- Whoo!

72
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,411
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

73
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,247
With my charm and your brains,
no problem.

74
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,591
Hey, girls, look what
just pulled into town.

75
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,761
- Hey, ladies!
- Your buffet table of love.

76
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,847
- Right here, right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

77
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,392
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

78
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,478
- Whoa!
- Wow!

79
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,981
Zini!

80
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,390
You're missing all the action, pal.
Come on.

81
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:53,602
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action! Whoo!

82
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,144
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

83
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,229
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.

84
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:23,358
With the ladies, before you know it
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.

85
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:28,864
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

86
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:33,327
No, we have two.

87
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,587
Well, it's never really
been his best event.

88
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,840
- He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar.

89
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:50,302
If only there was someone
on the island for you.

90
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,096
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

91
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,268
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

92
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,236
Whoa!

93
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,128
- What are they?
- I don't know.

94
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,665
- Dad?
- Something's wrong.

95
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,628
Aladar, where's Suri?

96
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,131
She's up in the tree.

97
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,878
Come on! Go, go! Come on!

98
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,088
- Mom!
- Suri!

99
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,841
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

100
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,386
- Mom!
- Suri, where are you?

101
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,310
Run, Aladar! Run! Run!

102
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,783
Yar, come on!

103
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,328
- Zini, jump! Jump!
- Zini, jump!

104
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,706
- Zini!
- Hold on!

105
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,102
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

106
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:31,106
Aladar! Over here!

107
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,034
Oh, Suri. Easy. Easy.

108
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,955
They're all gone.

109
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,415
Shh, shh.

110
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,544
I'm here.

111
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,797
Come on.
We can't stay here.

112
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,906
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

113
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,158
- Look!
- Whoa!

114
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,827
- Did you see that?
- What?

115
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,996
- I did.
- Me too!

116
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,957
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

117
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,169
- Leave it alone... Hey!
- Shh, Dad!

118
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,297
- I-It's scaring Suri here.
- No, it's not.

119
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,216
Everyone just be quiet.

120
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,248
- Yar, grab on!
- I can't reach!

121
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,428
Aladar, they're stopping!

122
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,348
Huh?

123
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,937
Stay out of my way!

124
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,566
You heard Kron.
Move it!

125
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,586
Watch it!

126
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,268
Zini, get your head down!

127
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:33,384
Walking backwards, huh? Well, let me
know if that gets you there any faster.

128
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:39,808
Keep those little legs moving, Url,
or you'll get left behind.

129
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,862
Look at all the Aladars!

130
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,449
I-If you're even thinking
of joining them...

131
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,495
Hang on! Hang on!

132
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:31,025
Kron. There is a more protected spot
further down the...

133
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,321
We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

134
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:52,881
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at
your nesting grounds now.

135
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:58,303
All this pushing and shoving about,
just for a place to sleep.

136
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,889
I'm not used to
this kind of behavior.

137
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:05,643
Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

138
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,062
Oh, I could not possibly.

139
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,940
Uh, uh, shoo, shoo.

140
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,942
Will you come on, Baylene?

141
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,613
You wanna get to the nesting grounds
alive? Show some backbone.

142
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,073
Hey there!

143
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:23,494
Oh, sorry about that. Uh, it's just
we overheard you talking, and, um...

144
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,210
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

145
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:34,631
He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

146
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:41,387
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.

147
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,056
Excuse me?

148
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,311
Um, he's my grandfather,
a couple times removed.

149
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,897
Try a couple of species removed.

150
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,108
Uh, uh, uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.

151
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,569
We're all that's left.

152
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,364
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.

153
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,616
Baylene's the last of her kind.

154
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,869
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

155
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:08,581
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds.

156
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,710
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

157
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,296
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

158
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,259
Will we find anybody
that looks like us there?

159
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:23,513
Oh, the last few days
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

160
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,015
Who knows what we'll find.

161
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,435
The hard job now
is just getting there.

162
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,188
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

163
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:37,318
- Kron, the herd's head honcho.
- We can hardly keep up.

164
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,614
A-An older woman like myself, it's...
well, it's positively indecent.

165
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,284
Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

166
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,911
Oh!

167
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:54,335
Hey! What's his problem?

168
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,339
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

169
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,384
Uh, excuse me.
Kron! You got a second?

170
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,722
- Get lost, kid.
- Relax, Bruton.

171
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:13,521
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

172
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:17,275
Why aren't you uphill with the...

173
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,819
uh, young bloods?

174
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,032
Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

175
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,951
I guess they... they're having
a hard time keeping up.

176
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,746
So, you know, maybe
you could slow it down a bit.

177
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:35,918
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

178
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:40,214
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

179
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,426
Hey, they need help back here.

180
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,763
Watch yourself, boy.

181
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,351
Don't worry. That's how
my brother treats newcomers.

182
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,020
No matter how charming they are.

183
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,564
You sure know how to
catch a girl's eye there, stud.

184
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:01,486
I wouldn't be catching nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

185
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,490
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

186
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:09,994
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

187
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,247
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

188
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,417
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my...

189
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:19,837
No, Yar, she's right... better to keep
our heads down with this bunch...

190
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,007
than get 'em bitten off by
those things.

191
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:28,012
Well, you just consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

192
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:58,876
Hey, wake up. Enough with the beauty
sleep. You're ravishing already.

193
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,339
Hey! Hello! Anybody in there?

194
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,093
Zini, what are you doing?

195
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:10,179
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

196
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,890
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

197
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,269
Something's up. The herd's gathering
without us. Let's check it out.

198
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:20,690
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

199
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,151
Come on. Get up.
On your feet.

200
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,654
The charm never stops around here.

201
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,949
- You say something?
- Uh, no. No, sir.

202
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:37,832
Unless you got a death wish, you and
that little parasite better get moving!

203
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,545
Sheesh, is that guy ugly, or what?

204
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,550
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

205
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:54,974
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about: Neera.

206
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:59,604
Scaly skin, yellow eyes, big ankles.

207
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,732
Yeah. I made
a real impression on her.

208
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,319
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

209
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,363
- "The love monkey"?
- Oh, baby!

210
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:21,751
That, children,
is what's known as a jerkosaurus.

211
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,256
And with that, the ice is broken.

212
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:40,394
We've got a lot of first timers here.
Make sure they get it.

213
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,731
We stop for nothing and no one.

214
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:49,570
If this is your first crossing,
listen up.

215
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:53,324
There is no water
till we reach the other side.

216
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:57,745
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own.

217
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,914
Move out!

218
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,051
Oh, my goodness.
It looks like a very long walk.

219
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:16,806
And hot. If you smell something
sizzling, it could be me.

220
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,592
- We're moving too slow.
- I'll pick up the pace.

221
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,729
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

222
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:09,191
That's all I need:
a monkey on my back.

223
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:53,361
On your feet, Eema.
We can't let those things eat you.

224
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,863
They're out there waiting.

225
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,788
The lake!

226
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,792
- We made it?
- It's just over that...that hill, baby.

227
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,919
Oh, thank goodness.

228
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,755
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

229
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,467
Well, it's time
to refresh my memory.

230
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:30,249
Ooh, I'm just gonna
walk right into that lake...

231
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,461
until the water's
up to my eyeballs...

232
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:36,714
and soak it all in.

233
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,895
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

234
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,233
What do you want us to do?

235
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,820
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

236
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,788
Enough!
You have to be strong now!

237
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:13,042
The nesting grounds are only
a few days away! Keep moving!

238
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:18,297
Kron, we've never gone this long
without water.

239
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,258
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

240
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,678
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

241
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,524
What, they're moving already?
Oh, we'll never keep up.

242
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,317
There was water here.

243
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,236
Always water here before.

244
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:47,326
We always had water.
Always.

245
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,621
And...And plenty of mud.

246
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:56,585
Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won't wait. We must carry on.

247
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,924
You gotta get up!

248
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,681
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

249
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,700
Baylene, don't move.

250
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,994
Uh, what is it? What's wrong?

251
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,623
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do.

252
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,126
Lift your foot, Baylene.

253
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,885
Now press down.

254
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:52,474
I always did like big girls!

255
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,853
- Water.
- Oh, my goodness!

256
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,528
- Water! Come on!
- They found water.

257
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,784
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

258
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,179
Kron, look.
All we had to do was dig and...

259
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,807
Good.
Now get out of the way.

260
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:49,031
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

261
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,754
Eema!

262
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,095
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

263
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:25,109
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

264
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:28,445
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

265
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,753
Let's get out of here.

266
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,117
Now, you come out on three.

267
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,746
One, two, three!

268
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,752
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

269
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:26,879
Hey, hey, what's going on?

270
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:31,717
The little Aladars haven't had anything
to drink. I think they're scared of me.

271
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,303
Well, who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

272
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:39,767
Come on over, guys.

273
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,061
Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.

274
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:46,190
And proud of it. Come on.
He's gonna find you some water.

275
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:03,499
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

276
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,422
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.
Knock it off.

277
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,674
Let's... Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork.

278
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:17,096
Ready?
One, two, three.

279
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:20,182
Press!

280
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:25,104
Good job, Suri.

281
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,606
So, where are your parents,
anyway?

282
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,025
A lot of us are on our own now.

283
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,448
- You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.

284
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:42,287
I'm Aladar, the jerkosaurus.

285
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,541
Oh. Sorry about that.

286
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:49,628
- Probably right.
- Dad, wake up.

287
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,630
Huh?

288
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,800
- Why did you help that old one?
- What else could we do?

289
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,427
Leave her behind?

290
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,473
Oh, you mean you actually...

291
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,851
Well, that happens all the time.

292
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,645
- You don't survive if you're not...
- Strong enough.

293
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,148
Well, yeah.

294
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,775
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

295
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:19,324
Everything's so different.
I... I don't know what to think anymore.

296
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,995
Look, Neera,
we watch out for each other...

297
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:26,081
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

298
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:29,334
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not.

299
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,837
But it's all I know.

300
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,716
So, um... Oh, water.

301
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,343
I'll, uh, get you some water.

302
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,305
- Can I try?
- Sure. Just press.

303
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:48,896
- Hmm.
- Oops!

304
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:51,273
- Sorry.
- No, you...you first.

305
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:55,068
One down and...

306
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:57,613
Well, one down.

307
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:23,055
Kron! Carnotaurs!

308
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,557
What?
They never come this far north.

309
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,685
The fireball
must've driven them out.

310
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:37,402
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!

311
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:39,905
Move the herd out, double-time!

312
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,835
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

313
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,091
Kron! What's going on?

314
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:02,094
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

315
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:05,430
But the others in the back,
they'll never make it.

316
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:10,018
- They'll slow down the predators.
- You can't sacrifice them like this!

317
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,940
Hold it! That could be
you back there, or you!

318
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,532
If you ever interfere again,
I'll kill you.

319
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,955
Stay away from him!

320
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:37,045
Aladar, no! You just...
Just go. I'll be okay.

321
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,138
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

322
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,140
- Carno-what?
- Carnotaur.

323
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:51,143
A mouth full of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

324
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:55,022
Come on, you guys, get on, get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

325
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:57,858
Go on.

326
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,569
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

327
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:03,405
Aladar, slow down!

328
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:55,457
Oh, joy. Blisters.

329
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,293
I've got blisters on my blisters.

330
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:02,589
You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

331
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,092
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

332
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:08,887
- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

333
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,891
- Okay, what the second worst thing it could be?
- Two carnotaurs!

334
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,143
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
- That's it! I'm gone!

335
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:19,064
Everybody! We don't know for sure. It
could be the herd. Let's check it out.

336
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,566
Goodness. Goodness gracious!

337
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,412
Oh, it's Bruton.

338
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:37,416
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

339
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,681
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs.

340
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:56,518
- Oh, we should keep moving.
- We can't just leave him here.

341
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,770
We can if we move fast enough.

342
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:03,483
Hey, uh, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

343
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:07,112
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.

344
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:10,407
- Now get away from me.
- Suit yourself.

345
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,224
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

346
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,153
It's dark, but at least it's dry.

347
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:52,491
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

348
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,868
Ouch! Sorry, Url.

349
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:57,746
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?

350
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,625
Ahem.
We appear to have a visitor.

351
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:31,696
You coming in, or what?

352
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,533
What is it with you?

353
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:37,577
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

354
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:40,705
Now come on. On your feet.

355
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:06,022
Uh, you can lie down with us.
It's warmer.

356
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,783
May I remind you
that he's one of them?

357
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,245
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

358
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:32,090
Who booked this trip, anyway?

359
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,759
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

360
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:38,638
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

361
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:41,182
You tell him, Eema.

362
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:52,444
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

363
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:56,698
If you could sleep that deep, honey,
you'd be dead.

364
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:03,913
This plant grew on our island.

365
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:07,626
It will make you feel better.

366
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:22,724
Why is he doing this,
pushing them on with false hope?

367
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,852
It's hope that's gotten us
this far.

368
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:30,065
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

369
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:34,819
- I've accepted mine.
- And what is your fate?

370
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,489
To die here.

371
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:42,202
- It's the way things are.
- Only if you give up, Bruton.

372
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:45,580
It's your choice, not your fate.

373
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:52,087
Well, the plant will help.

374
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:40,802
- Wow.
- Shh. Carnotaurs.

375
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,810
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

376
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:44,115
Go, go! Hurry!

377
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,453
Move it, Eema!

378
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:57,545
Aladar! Aladar! Oh, no!

379
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,806
I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

380
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:45,093
Bruton!

381
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,939
Bruton! No!

382
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,203
Bruton!

383
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,558
You did what you could.

384
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:39,999
It's okay, little ones.

385
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,710
We're going to make it.

386
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:11,990
Okay, okay, let's do it again. Let's do
it again. Um, I spy with my little eye...

387
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:15,702
- A rock.
- You got it again! Ooh, you are good!

388
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:20,665
Well, I'll tell you what I spy...
a dead end.

389
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:31,175
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

390
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:37,098
- Hold on a moment.
- Zini, what is it?

391
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,935
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah!

392
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:56,534
- Get a load of that!
- Good show!

393
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:59,954
Everybody stand back!
We're out of here!

394
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,796
Run!

395
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,799
Aladar, look out!

396
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,225
No!

397
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:59,097
Aladar, we'll go back.

398
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,101
Back to what? It's gone.

399
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:05,520
We're not meant to survive.

400
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:10,608
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

401
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:13,945
And how dare you waste that
good fortune by simply giving up?

402
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,949
Well, shame on you.
Shame on you, shame on you.

403
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:22,161
The worst of it is,
you allowed an old fool like me...

404
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:25,623
to believe I was needed,
that I still had a purpose.

405
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:29,460
And do you know what?
You were right.

406
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:32,004
And I'm going to go on
believing it.

407
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:36,259
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

408
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:28,269
Oh, dear.

409
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:49,332
The nesting grounds.
It's... It's untouched.

410
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:16,484
- Our new home.
- And it comes with a pool!

411
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,827
Cannonball!

412
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:30,748
Ha. Amateur.

413
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:34,168
Look out below!

414
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:54,146
Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?

415
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,525
Not to mention Neera.

416
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:02,363
They'll get here soon enough.

417
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,412
- Oh, no.
- Eema?

418
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,293
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

419
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,921
That is the way
we used to get in here.

420
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,971
They'll never make it over that.

421
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:31,684
Aladar, wait, wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

422
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:34,562
Let him try.

423
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:39,608
I hope Kron's
in a listening mood.

424
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,462
Stay here.

425
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:07,386
We'll find a way around it.

426
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,015
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

427
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,077
We have to keep trying.

428
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,998
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

429
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:20,584
Now, let's go home!

430
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,973
- You'll make it, won't you, boys?
- No!

431
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:38,519
Watch them. They're tough.
If they can do it, so can you!

432
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,531
Kron!

433
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:54,243
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur's coming!

434
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,957
- Keep moving!
- Stop!

435
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,585
I've been to the valley.
There's a safer way.

436
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,008
- Go on. Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

437
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:13,220
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where? Straight to the carnotaurs?

438
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:17,016
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

439
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,560
There's a sheer drop
on the other side.

440
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:25,649
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it!

441
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,402
Now follow me!

442
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:32,114
Kron!

443
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,410
They're staying with me!

444
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:39,622
All right, let's go.

445
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,469
Neera!

446
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:36,697
He's led that monster right to us!
This way!

447
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:40,034
No! Don't move!

448
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:44,204
If we scatter, he'll pick us off.
Stand together.

449
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,998
Kron!

450
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:34,857
No. No.

451
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:51,809
Kron.

452
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:51,034
Welcome home.

453
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:29,907
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

454
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:34,244
I'd say it's been a few years
since you hatched an egg.

455
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:37,664
You're right.
So let me practice on your head.

456
01:13:37,748 --> 01:13:41,877
Look!
Somebody wants to meet you.

457
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:52,012
Oh, aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see.

458
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:55,974
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

459
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:59,353
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

460
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,774
Oh! Oh, happy day.

461
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:07,778
- Well done, little one.
- Come here, you little rascal.

462
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,864
Let me get a good look at you.

463
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:17,663
Yep, you're your father's son,
all right.

464
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:22,000
Hey, look what I found!
New neighbors!

465
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,796
Any of you ladies up for a game of,
uh, "monkey in the middle"?

466
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:29,216
Easy, now! Easy! Hey! Whoo!

467
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:23,687
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

468
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,233
One thing is certain...
our journey's not over.

469
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:32,195
We can only hope that
in some small way...

470
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:35,323
our time here will be remembered.
