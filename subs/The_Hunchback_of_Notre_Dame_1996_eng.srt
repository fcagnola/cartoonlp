what's goin' on out there?

- A festival.

- Uh-huh.

- I don't get it.
- Perhaps he's sick.

112
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:03,113
Impossible. If 20 years of
listenin' to you two hasn't made
him sick by now, nothin' will.

- Me?
- No, the Pope. Of course, you!

126

of educational experience.

127
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:10,306
- Wine, women and song.
- You can learn to identify
various regional cheeses.

128
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:14,476
- Bobbin' for snails.
- Study indigenous folk music.
- Playin' dunk the monk!

129
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,647
Quasi, take it from an old spectator.
Life's not a spectator sport.

130
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:20,608
If watchin'
is all you're gonna do,

131
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:23,110
then you're gonna watch
your life go by without ya.

132

135
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:36,415

and a clean pair of hose, and...

137
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,005
Thanks for the encouragement.
But you're all forgetting one big thing.

138
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:46,759
- What?
- My master, Frollo.

139
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,928

- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, dear, yes.

140
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:53,223
W-Well, when he says you're forbidden
from ever leaving the bell tower,

141
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:55,309
d-does he mean
"ever," ever?

142
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,978
Never ever. And he hates
the Feast of Fools.

143
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,607
- He'd be furious if I asked to go.
- Who says ya gotta ask?

144
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,609
- Oh, no.
- Ya sneak out...

145
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,444
- It's just one afternoon.
- I couldn't.

146
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,404
And ya sneak back in.

147
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,448
- He'll never know you were gone.
- And if I got caught?

148
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:11,617
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

149
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,495
- He might see me.
- You could wear a disguise.
Just this once.

can't hurt ya.

151
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:18,499

00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:06,547
Oh, yes, Master.
I would like that very much.

167
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,800
- Very well. "A"?
- Abomination.

168
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,802
- "B"?
- Blasphemy.

169
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,804
- "C"?
- C-Contrition.

170
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,306
- "D"?
- Damnation.

171
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,474
- "E"?
- Eternal damnation.

172
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:20,394
- Good. "F"?
- Festival.

173
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:23,564
- Excuse me?
- F-Forgiveness.

174
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,275
- You said, "Festival."
- No!

175
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:29,403
You are thinking
about going to the festival.

176
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:31,905
L-It's just that
you go every year.

177
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:35,242
I am a public official.
I must go.

178
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,995
But I don't
enjoy a moment.

179
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,332
Thieves and cutpurses,
the dregs of humankind,

180
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:45,878
all mixed together
in a shallow, drunken stupor.

181
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,048
I didn't mean
to upset you, Master.

182
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,092
Quasimodo,
can't you understand?

183
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:55,429
When your heartless mother
abandoned you as a child,

184
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:57,932
anyone else
would have drowned you.

185
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,602
And this is my thanks for taking you in
and raising you as my son?

186
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:03,354
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,898

Ahh!

262
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:03,570
Stay away, child. They're Gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.

263
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,134
All right, Gypsy.

264
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:28,137
- Where'd ya get the money?
- For your information, I earned it.

265
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,599
- Gypsies don't earn money.
- They steal it.

266
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,809
You'd know
a lot about stealing.

267
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,853
Troublemaker, eh?

268
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,480
Maybe a day in the stocks
will cool ya down.

269
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:40,566
- Oof!
- Oof!

270
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,653
Come back here,
Gypsy!

271
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,034
- Achilles, sit.
- Whoa!

272
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:52,745
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

273
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,747
Naughty horse!
Naughty!

274
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:58,417
He's just impossible. Really,
I can't take him anywhere.

275
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,128
Get this thing off me!

276
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:05,049
I'll teach you a lesson, peasant!

277
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,551
You were saying...
Lieutenant?

278
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,678
Oh, C-Captain!

279
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:13,390
Ow! At your service, sir!

280
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,227
I know you have a lot
on your mind right now,

281
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,897
but the Palace ofJustice?

282
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,817
- Make way for the Captain!
- Go on, make way!

283
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,195
Make way!

284
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:29,239
- Everybody out of the way!
- You, make way for the Captain!

285
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,241
- Make way!
- Make way, now!

286
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,290
Come on, boy.
Achilles, heel!

287
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,269
- Stop.
- Sir?

288
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,562
Ease up.
Wait between lashes.

289
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,524
Otherwise the old sting
will dull him to the new.

290
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,526
Yes, sir.

291
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:09,363
Ah, so this is the gallant Captain
Phoebus, home from the wars.

292
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:11,365
Reporting for duty,
as ordered, sir.

293
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:14,076
Your service record
precedes you, Phoebus.

294
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,788
I expect nothing but the best
from a war hero of your caliber.

295
00:19:17,871 --> 00:19:21,041
- And you shall have it, sir.
I guarantee it.
- Yes.

296
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:25,629
You know, my last
Captain of the Guard was, um,
a bit of a disappointment to me.

297
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:31,552
Well, no matter. I'm sure
you'll whip my men into shape.

298
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:33,554
Uh, thank you.
It's a grea...

299
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,556
tre... uh,
tremendous honor, sir.

300
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,392
You've come to Paris
in her darkest hour, Captain.

301
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,145
It will take a firm hand
to save the weak-minded...

302
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,481
- from being so easily misled.
- Misled, sir?

303
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:49,486
Look, Captain. Gypsies. The Gypsies
live outside the normal order.

304
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,490
Their heathen ways inflame
the people's lowest instincts.

305
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:56,243
And they
must be stopped.

306
00:19:56,327 --> 00:20:00,080
I was summoned from the wars to capture
fortune-tellers and palm readers?

307
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:03,876
Eh, the real war, Captain,
is what you see before you.

308
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:08,047
For 20 years, I have been
taking care of the Gypsies,

309
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:11,425
one... by... one.

310
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:15,512
And yet, for all my success,
they have thrived.

311
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,767
I believe they have a safe haven
within the walls of this very city.

312
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,102
A nest, if you will.

313
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,356
They call it
the Court of Miracles.

314
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:30,402
What are we going to do
about it, sir?

315
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:32,780
You make your point
quite vividly, sir.

316
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:35,783
You know, I like you, Captain.
Shall we?

317
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,828
Oh, duty calls.

318
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:44,124
- Have you ever attended
a peasant festival, Captain?
- Not recently, sir.

319
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,253

415
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:11,929
Master, please,
help me!

416
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:19,228
Sir, request permission
to stop this cruelty.

417
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:23,565
In a moment, Captain. A lesson
needs to be learned here.

418
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,457
Don't be afraid.

419
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,919
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,879
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

421
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:49,758
You! Gypsy girl!

422
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,927
Get down at once!

423
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:55,222
Yes, Your Honor. Just as soon
as I free this poor creature.

424
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,058
I forbid it!

425
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:01,729
How dare you defy me?

426
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,857
You mistreat this poor boy the same way
you mistreat my people.

427
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,611
You speak of justice, yet you are cruel
to those most in need of your help.

428
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:11,614
- Silence!
- Justice!

429
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:19,830
Mark my words, Gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.

430
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,666
Then it appears
we've crowned the wrong fool.

431
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,377
The only fool I see
is you!

432
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,215
Captain Phoebus,
arrest her.

433
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:37,932
Now, let's see. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

434
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:42,519
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?

435
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,525
Witchcraft!

436
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,278
Oh, boys. Over here.

437
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,490
- There she is!
- Get her!

438
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,443
I'm free!
I'm free! Ooh!

439
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,529
Dang it.

440
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:41,579
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

441
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:51,380
What a woman.

442
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,887
Whoa!

443
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:23,454
Find her, Captain.
I want her alive.

444
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,372
Yes, sir.
Seal off the area, men.

445
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,834
Find the Gypsy girl
and do not harm her.

446
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:42,556
I'm sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.

447
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,980
Stand back. Stand back.

448
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:51,982
Oh, he's hideous.

449
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:23,013
You, there, get away! Move on.

450
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,848
Hmm.

451
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,585
You!

452
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,712
Easy, easy.
L-l-I just shaved this morning.

453
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:58,424
- Oh, really? You missed a spot.
- All right, all right.

454
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:00,384
Just calm down. Just give me
a chance to apologize.

455
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:03,137
- For what?
- That, for example.

456
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,641
- You sneaky son of a...
- Ah, ah, ah. Watch it.
You're in a church.

457
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:10,853
Are you always this charming,
or am I just lucky?

458
00:32:10,936 --> 00:32:13,272
Whoa!

459
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,108
Candlelight,
privacy, music.

460
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,402
Can't think of a better place
for hand-to-hand combat.

461
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:21,071
Ooh! You fight
almost as well as a man.

462
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:24,074
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

463
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:26,118
That's hitting a little below
the belt, don't you think?

464
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:29,413
No. This is.

465
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:32,750
Touche. Ohh!

466
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,503
- I didn't know you had a kid.
- Well, he doesn't
take kindly to soldiers.

467
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,505
Uh, I noticed.

468
00:32:38,547 --> 00:32:40,549
Ah, permit me.

469
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:44,011
I'm Phoebus.
It means "Sun God."

470
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,642
- And you are?
- Is this an interrogation?

471
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:51,977
I believe it's called
an introduction.

472
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,648
- You're not arresting me?
- Not as long as you're in here.
I can't.

473
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:58,692
Huh. You're not at all
like the other soldiers.

474
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,819
Thank you.

475
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:04,281
So... if you're not going to arrest me,
what do you want?

476
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:07,076
I'd settle for your name.

477
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,954
- Esmeralda.
- Beautiful.

478
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:14,667
Much better
than Phoebus, anyway.

479
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:22,883
Good work, Captain.
Now arrest her.

480
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,262
Claim "sanctuary."

481
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:30,923
- Say it!
- You tricked me.

482
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,312
- I'm waiting, Captain.
- I'm sorry, sir. She claimed sanctuary.

483
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:39,400
- There's nothing I can do.
- Then drag her outside and...

484
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,569
Frollo, you will not
touch her! Don't worry.

485
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:47,366
Minister Frollo learned years ago
to respect the sanctity of the church.

486
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,044
All right, all right.
I'm going.

487
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:04,717
You think you've outwitted me.

488
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,844
But I'm a patient man.

489
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:11,682
And Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.

490
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,769
What are you doing?

491
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:20,524
I was just imagining a rope
around that beautiful neck.

492
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:25,070
- I know what you were imagining.
- Such a clever witch.

493
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:27,865
So typical of your kind
to twist the truth...

494
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:31,201
to cloud the mind
with unholy thoughts.

495
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,203
Well, no matter.

496
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:37,124
You've chosen
a magnificent prison.

497
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,002
But it is a prison,
nonetheless.

498
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:44,381
Set one foot outside,
and you're mine.

499
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:53,474
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.

500
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,726
Oh!

501
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,187
Don't worry, Djali.

502
00:34:58,354 --> 00:35:02,441
- If Frollo thinks
he can keep us here, he's wrong.
- Don't act rashly, my child.

503
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:05,903
You created quite a stir
at the festival.

504
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:09,114
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.

505
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:13,035
You saw what he did out there,
letting the crowd torture that poor boy.

506
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:16,705
I thought if just one person
could stand up to him, then...

507
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,709
What do they have against
people who are different, anyway?

508
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:24,505
You can't right all the wrongs
of this world by yourself.

509
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:27,549
No one out there is going
to help, that's for sure.

510
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:31,387
Well, perhaps there's
someone in here who can.

What are you doing down here?

Oh!

548
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:41,035
- Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?
- Wait.

549
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:44,413
L-I want
to talk to you.

550
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,000
Look, he's got
a friend with him.

551
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,461
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't
a total loss after all.

552
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:53,172
- A vision of loveliness.
- The one in the dress ain't bad either.

553
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:55,090
- Way to go, Quasi!
- Congratulations.

554
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:58,177
- We knew you had it in ya.
- Got the girls chasin' ya already.

555
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,930
- Actually, l...
- You mustn't run too fast,
or she'll get away.

556
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,890
Yes, l-I know.
That's what l...

557
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:04,725
Give her some slack,
then reel her in.

558
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,852
Then give her some slack,
then reel her in.

559
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:10,606
- Then give her some slack...
- Knock it off, Hugo.
She's a girl, not a mackerel.

560
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,484
Here you are.
I was afraid I'd lost you.

561
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:16,487
Yes. Well, I, uh...

562
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,784
I have chores to do. L-It was nice...
seeing... you... again.

563
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:23,827
- Oh!
- No, wait!

564
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.

565
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,087
I would never in my life
have pulled you...

566
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:38,509
up... on... the...

567
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,427
stage.

568
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,516
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.

569
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,228
Did you make
all these things yourself?

570
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,188
- Most of them.
- This is beautiful.

571
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:54,275
If I could do this, you wouldn't find me
dancing in the streets for coins.

572
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,405
- But you're a wonderful dancer.
- It keeps bread on the table,
anyway. What's this?

573
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,032
Oh! No, please!
L-l-I'm not finished.

574
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:07,246
- I still have to paint them.
- It's
the blacksmith and the baker!

575
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:13,711
You're a surprising person,
Quasimodo.

576
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:17,172
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.

577
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:19,216
Well, it's not just me.

578
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,429
There's the gargoyles
and, of course, the bells.

579
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:27,057
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?

580
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,937
Follow me.
I'll introduce you.

581
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:35,691
- I never knew there were so many.
- That's Little Sophia.

582
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:38,110
And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.

583
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,154
Triplets, you know.

584
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,406
- And who's this?
- Big Marie.

585
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:45,242
Hello!

586
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:47,912
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?

587
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:50,873
How about it, Djali?

588
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:53,365
- We'd love to.
- Good.

589
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,836
I've saved
the best for last.

590
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:04,011
Oh!

591
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,475
I bet the king himself
doesn't have a view like this.

592
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:12,770
- I could stay up here forever.
- Y-You could, you know.

593
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,688
No, I couldn't.

594
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,650
- Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
- But not freedom.

595
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:20,527
"Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls."

596
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:25,199
But y-y-you're not like other
Gypsies. They are... evil.

597
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,285
- Who told you that?
- My master, Frollo.

598
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:32,206
- He raised me.
- How can such a cruel man
have raised someone like you?

599
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:34,208
Cruel? Oh, no.

600
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,544
He saved my life. He took me in
when no one else would.

601
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:40,381
- I am a monster, you know.
- He told you that?

602
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:43,467
Look at me.

603
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,011
- Give me your hand. Just let me see it.
- What?

604
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,640
Hmm. A long lifeline.

605
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:53,185
Oh, and this one
means you're shy.

606
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,604
Hmm. Hmm, mmm, mmm.

607
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,564
- Well, that's funny.
- What?

608
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,484
- I don't see any...
- Any what?

609
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:04,196
Monster Lines.
Not a single one.

610
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:07,199
Now you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?

611
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:11,495
No! No, no. You are
kind and good and-and...

612
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,041
And a Gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong
about the both of us.

613
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,169
- What did she say?
- Frollo's nose is long,
and he wears a truss.

614
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:21,130
Ha! Told ya!
Pay up.

615
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:23,132
- Oh, dear.
- Chump.

616
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:29,305
You helped me.
Now I will help you.

617
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:32,099
But there's no way out.
There're soldiers at every door.

618
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,143
We won't use a door.

619
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:36,437
- You mean, climb down?
- Sure.

620
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,982
- You carry him. I carry you.
- Okay.

621
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,277
Come on, Djali.

622
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:46,697
- Ready?
- Yes.

623
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,908
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

624
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:52,244
- Now I'm afraid.
- The trick is not to look down.

625
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:58,125
You've done this before?

626
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:01,462
No.

627
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,506
Ooh!

628
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:12,556
Wow, you're
quite an acrobat.

629
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,600
Thank you. Whoa!

630
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,602
Whoa!

631
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,236
- Check the alley!
- This way!

632
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:39,667
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Not for an instant.

633
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,670
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.

634
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,756
- Come with me.
- What?

635
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,217
- To the Court of Miracles.
Leave this place.
- Oh, no.

636
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,095
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.

637
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:53,962
No. This is
where I belong.

638
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,141
All right,
then I'll come to see you.

639
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:00,104
- Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!
- I'll come after sunset.

640
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,941
But at sunset, I ring the evening mass,
and after that I clean the cloisters.

641
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:07,486
And then I ring the vespers,
and... Whatever's good for you.

642
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,532
If you ever need sanctuary,
this will show you the way.

643
00:44:11,574 --> 00:44:13,534
- But how?
- Just remember:

644
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:18,581
When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand.

645
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,463
- Hurry. You must go.
- Check the alley.

646
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:30,092
Yes, sir. No one here, sir.

647
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:32,177
No one here, sir.

648
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:34,430
Check the street.

649
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,394
Hi, there.

650
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,480
- I'm looking for the Gypsy
girl. Have you seen her?

651
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:47,693
- Whoa, whoa! Easy!
- No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out!

652
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:49,486
- Wait! All I want is to...
- Go!

653
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:54,199
- I mean her no harm.
- Go!

654
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:59,914
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here.

655
00:44:59,955 --> 00:45:02,666
But it was the only way
I could save her life.

656
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,211
Will you tell her that?
Will you?

657
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:08,589
If you go. Now.

658
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:10,841
I'll go.

659
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:14,470
Now, will you...
put me down, please?

660
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:23,395
Oh, and one more thing.

661
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:26,941
- Tell Esmeralda... she's very lucky.
- Why?

662
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:30,277
To have a friend like you.

663
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:38,285
Hey, hey!
There he is!

664
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:44,291
You ejected that tin-plated
buffoon with great panache.

665
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,003
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here,
tryin' to steal your girl.

666
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:51,674
- My girl?
- Esmeralda. Dark hair,
works with a goat, remember?

667
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,051
Boy, I do.

- Oh.
- Are you feeling all right?

744
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:37,561
I had a little trouble
with the fireplace.

- Find the Gypsy girl.

Ten pieces of silver
for the Gypsy, Esmeralda.

00:51:54,036 --> 00:51:55,913

Twenty pieces of silver

Take them away!

750
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:23,691
- Poor miller.
He's never harmed anyone!
- Frollo's gone mad.

751
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:28,195
We found this Gypsy talisman
on your property. Have you been
harboring Gypsies?

752
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:32,324
Our home is always open
to the weary traveller.
Have mercy, my lord.

753
00:52:32,408 --> 00:52:36,161
I am placing you and your family
under house arrest until I get
to the bottom of this.

innocent, then you have nothing to fear.

we know nothing of these Gypsies.

00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,011
- Burn it.
- What?

757
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:56,682
Until it smoulders. These people are
traitors and must be made examples of.

758
00:52:56,765 --> 00:53:00,227
With all due respect, sir, I was
not trained to murder the innocent.

759
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:03,272
But you were trained
to follow orders.

Such a pity. You threw away
a promising career.

Consider it
my highest honor, sir.

00:53:59,828 --> 00:54:03,374
Get him!
And don't hit my horse!

765
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:18,555

But now don't you say
anything to upset Quasimodo.
He's worried enough already.

779
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:28,626

We better lighten up.
- Shh. Here he comes.

Oh, it's a lost cause!
She could be anywhere!

783
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:42,765
In the stocks,
in the dungeon, on the rack!

00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,767
Oh!

she'll be back. You'll see.

00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,450

Quasi?

845
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,307
Quasimodo?

846
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:13,642
Esmeralda?

847
00:59:13,726 --> 00:59:17,313
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!

848
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,482
You've done so much
for me already, my friend.

849
00:59:20,566 --> 00:59:24,862
- But I must ask your help
one more time.
- Yes, anything.

850
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:31,201
This is Phoebus. He's wounded and
a fugitive like me.

851
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:35,289
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.

852
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,291
Please, can you hide him?

853
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:40,127
This way.

854
00:59:45,674 --> 00:59:47,968
Oh. Esmeralda.

855
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:52,431
Shh-h-h. You'll hide here
until you're strong enough to move.

856
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,436
Great.
I could use a drink.

857
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,148
Aah! Yes. Mmm.

858
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:05,069
Feels like a 1470 burgundy.
Not a good year.

859
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:07,863
That family owes you
their lives.

860
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:12,618
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.

861
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:15,663
Ex-soldier, remember?

862
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:19,541
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?

863
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,961
You're lucky.

864
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,296
That arrow
almost pierced your heart.

865
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:28,300
I'm not so sure
it didn't.

866
01:00:43,232 --> 01:00:48,070
♪ I knew I'd never know

867
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:53,117

870
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:26,650
Frollo's coming.
You must leave.

871
01:01:26,734 --> 01:01:30,946
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.

872
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:35,034
Be careful, my friend. Promise you won't
let anything happen to him.

873
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:38,829
- I promise.
- Thank you.

874
01:01:40,748 --> 01:01:43,375
Quick, we gotta stash
the stiff.

875
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:02,603
Oh. Oh, Master, l-l-l-I
didn't think you'd be coming.

876
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:06,232
I am never too busy to share
a meal with you, dear boy.

877
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:09,652
I brought a little... treat.

878
01:02:11,654 --> 01:02:14,323
Oh!

879
01:02:20,955 --> 01:02:23,874
Is there something
troubling you, Quasimodo?

880
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:26,961
- Oh. No!
- Oh, but there is.

881
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:30,589
I know there is.

882
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:43,811
I think
you're hiding something.

883
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,896
Oh, no, Master.
L... There's no...

884
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,985
- You're not eating, boy.
It's very good. Thank you.

885
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,821
Mmm.

886
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:01,662
Seeds.

887
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:04,873
What's different
in here?

888
01:03:04,957 --> 01:03:06,875
Nothing... sir.

889
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:10,796
Isn't this one new?

890
01:03:10,879 --> 01:03:16,135
It's awfully good. It looks
very much like the Gypsy girl.

891
01:03:16,218 --> 01:03:20,931
I know
you helped her escape!

892
01:03:21,015 --> 01:03:25,769
And now all Paris is burning
because of you!

893
01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:28,272
She was kind
to me, Master.

894
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:32,359
You idiot! That wasn't
kindness. It was cunning!

895
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:36,655
She's a Gypsy! Gypsies are
not capable of real love!

896
01:03:36,739 --> 01:03:40,784
Think, boy.
Think of your mother.

897
01:03:44,204 --> 01:03:48,542
But what chance could
a poor, misshapen child like you...

898
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:52,129
have against her
heathen treachery?

899
01:03:52,212 --> 01:03:55,257
Well, never you mind,
Quasimodo.

900
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:57,551
She'll be out of our lives
soon enough.

901
01:03:57,635 --> 01:04:00,804
I will free you
from her evil spell.

902
01:04:00,888 --> 01:04:03,557
She will torment you
no longer.

903
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:05,559
What do you mean?

904
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:08,437
I know
where her hide-out is.

905
01:04:08,479 --> 01:04:11,607
And tomorrow at dawn,
I attack...

906
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:14,360
with a thousand men.

907
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:28,332
Ah. We have to find the Court
of Miracles before daybreak.

908
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:31,418
If Frollo gets there first...
Are you coming with me?

909
01:04:31,502 --> 01:04:35,297
- I can't.
- I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.

910
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:38,050
Frollo's my master.
I can't disobey him again.

911
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:41,762
She stood up for you. You've got
a funny way of showing gratitude.

912
01:04:45,266 --> 01:04:49,061
Well, I'm not going to sit by and watch
Frollo massacre innocent people.

913
01:04:49,144 --> 01:04:51,063
You do what
you think is right.

914
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:58,779
What? What am I
supposed to do?

915
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:01,782
Go out there and rescue the girl from
the... from the jaws of death,

916
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:04,827
and the whole town will cheer
like I'm some kind of a hero?

917
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:08,664
She already has her knight
in shining armor, and it's not me.

918
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,170
Frollo was right. Frollo was
right about everything.

919
01:05:15,254 --> 01:05:18,215
I'm tired of trying to be
something that I'm not.

920
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,446
I must be
out of my mind.

921
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:44,450
- Phoebus!
- Aah!

922
01:05:44,533 --> 01:05:46,702
- Shh! I'm coming with you!
- Glad you changed your mind.

923
01:05:46,785 --> 01:05:50,164
- I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for her.
- You know where she is?

924
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,791
No, but she said that this
will help us find her.

925
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:55,878
Good, good, good.
Ahh, great.

926
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:57,922
What is it?

927
01:05:57,963 --> 01:06:01,342
- I'm not sure.
- Hmm. It must be some sort of code.

928
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:04,637
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.

929
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,308
- " When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand."
- What?

930
01:06:09,391 --> 01:06:11,810
- It's the city.
- What are you talking about?

931
01:06:11,852 --> 01:06:15,773
It's a map. See, here's
the cathedral and the river,
and this little stone must be...

932
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:18,192
- I've never seen a map
that looks like...
- I've lived in the tower for 20 years.

933
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,986
- And I think I know what
the city looks like from above.

934
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,197
- This is it.
- This is not it.

935
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:28,661
All right. Okay.
If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map.

936
01:06:28,744 --> 01:06:32,122
But if we're going to find Esmeralda,
we have to work together.

937
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:34,083
Truce?

938
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:37,544
- Well, okay.
- Aah! Mmm.

939
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:40,256
Sorry.

940
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:42,216
No, you're not.

941
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,856
- This looks like the symbol on the map.
- But what does it mean?

942
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,235
Hmm. I'm not sure.

943
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:05,739
I can make out an inscription,
but it's going to take
a few minutes to translate it.

944
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:10,619
Yes, well. Or we could
just go down those stairs.

945
01:07:19,128 --> 01:07:21,547
Is this the Court of Miracles?

946
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:25,384
Offhand, I'd say it's
the Court of Ankle-deep Sewage.

947
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:27,636
Must be the old catacombs.

948
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:35,394
Cheerful place.

949
01:07:35,477 --> 01:07:39,231
- Kinda makes ya wish ya got out
more often, eh, Quasi?
- Not me.

950
01:07:39,315 --> 01:07:42,943
I just want to warn Esmeralda
and get back to the bell tower
before I get in more trouble.

951
01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:46,572
Speaking of trouble, we should
have run into some by now.

952
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:50,618
- What do you mean?
- You know. A guard. A booby trap.

953
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:53,037
Or an ambush.

954
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:01,462
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

955
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:04,048
- Trespassers!
- Spies!
- We're not spies.

956
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:06,967
- You've got to listen...
- Don't interrupt me.

957
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,845
You're very clever
to have found our hideaway.

958
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:14,475

- Why didn't they say so?
- We did say so.

988
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,732
This is the soldier
who saved the miller's family.

989
01:09:44,815 --> 01:09:47,109
And Quasimodo helped me
escape the cathedral.

990
01:09:47,192 --> 01:09:49,945
We came to warn you.
Frollo's coming!

991
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:55,200
He says he knows where you're
hiding, and he's attacking
at dawn with a thousand men.

992
01:09:55,284 --> 01:09:58,120
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.

993
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:04,126
You took a terrible risk
coming here.

994
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:07,922
It may not exactly show,
but we're grateful.

995
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,051
Don't thank me.
Thank Quasimodo.

996
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:16,388
- Without his help, I would never
have found my way here.
- Nor would I.

997
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:29,818
After 20 years
of searching,

998
01:10:29,902 --> 01:10:33,781
the Court of Miracles
is mine at last.

999
01:10:33,864 --> 01:10:36,617
Dear Quasimodo.

1000
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,829
- I always knew you would
someday be of use to me.
- No.

1001
01:10:40,913 --> 01:10:45,167
- What are you talking about?
- Why, he led me right to you, my dear.

1002
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:49,296
- You're a liar.
- And look what else
I've caught in my net.

1003
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,299
Captain Phoebus,
back from the dead.

1004
01:10:52,383 --> 01:10:55,469
Another "miracle," no doubt.

1005
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,097
I shall remedy that.

1006
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,518
There'll be a little bonfire
in the square tomorrow.

1007
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,437
And you're all
invited to attend.

1008
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:07,940
Lock them up.

1009
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:10,776
No, please, Master!

1010
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:15,239
No, no.

1011
01:11:15,281 --> 01:11:19,326
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.

1012
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:32,798
The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been found
guilty of the crime of witchcraft.

1013
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:37,886
The sentence: Death!

1014
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:57,364
The time has come, Gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.

1015
01:11:57,448 --> 01:12:00,159
Yet even now
it is not too late.

1016
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:05,581
I can save you from the flames
of this world and the next.

1017
01:12:05,664 --> 01:12:08,626
Choose me...
or the fire.

1018
01:12:13,464 --> 01:12:18,385
The Gypsy, Esmeralda,
has refused to recant.

1019
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:23,057
This evil witch has put the soul
of every citizen in Paris...

1020
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,100
in awful jeopardy.

1021
01:12:26,602 --> 01:12:29,021
Come on, Quasi.
Snap out of it!

1022
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:31,649
- Your friends are down there.
- It's all my fault.

1023
01:12:31,732 --> 01:12:36,070
- You gotta break these chains.
- I can't. I tried. What
difference would it make?

1024
01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:39,156
- But you can't let Frollo win!
- He already has.

1025
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,992
So you're givin' up?
That's it?

1026
01:12:42,076 --> 01:12:45,537
- These chains aren't what's
holding you back, Quasimodo.
- Leave me alone.

1027
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:53,170
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave ya alone.

1028
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:55,464
After all, we're
only made out of stone.

1029
01:12:55,547 --> 01:12:58,717
We just thought maybe you were made
of somethin' stronger.

1030
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:05,683
Forjustice, for Paris,

1031
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:10,437
and for her own salvation,
it is my sacred duty...

1032
01:13:10,521 --> 01:13:13,649
to send
this unholy demon...

1033
01:13:13,732 --> 01:13:16,986
back where she belongs.

1034
01:13:18,445 --> 01:13:20,447
No!

1035
01:14:10,706 --> 01:14:14,293
Quasimodo!

1036
01:14:24,762 --> 01:14:28,182
Sanctuary!

1037
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:30,059
Sanctuary!

1038
01:14:33,145 --> 01:14:36,357
Sanctuary!

1039
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,901
- Captain.
- Sir?
- Seize the cathedral.

1040
01:14:40,861 --> 01:14:43,322
Don't worry.
You'll be safe here.

1041
01:14:43,405 --> 01:14:46,200
Charge!

1042
01:15:01,382 --> 01:15:03,634
Come back, you cowards!

1043
01:15:03,717 --> 01:15:08,222
You, men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.

1044
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:11,809
Alone at last.

1045
01:15:11,892 --> 01:15:16,063
Citizens of Paris!

1046
01:15:16,146 --> 01:15:20,526
Frollo has persecuted our people,
ransacked our city!

1047
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:25,823
- Now he has declared war
on Notre Dame herself!

1048
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:28,492
Will we allow it?

1049
01:15:38,877 --> 01:15:42,631
- I think the cavalry's here.
Hey, isn't that... Feeble?
- Doofus.

1050
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:46,468
Phoebus!

1051
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:55,769
Sorry. Sorry.

1052
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:05,237
Harder!

1053
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:12,953
Ooh!
L-I'm free! I'm free!

1054
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:15,664
Oof! Dang it!

1055
01:16:21,128 --> 01:16:23,881
Aah!

1056
01:16:26,216 --> 01:16:28,469
Ready, aim,

1057
01:16:28,552 --> 01:16:30,471
fire!

1058
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:37,353
Are you sure that's how it works?

1059
01:16:37,394 --> 01:16:40,356
Works for me.

1060
01:16:46,737 --> 01:16:50,783
- Achilles, sit.
- Aah! Get off me!

1061
01:16:50,824 --> 01:16:55,746
Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly!

1062
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,294
Put your backs into it!

1063
01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:37,079
Frollo, have you
gone mad?

1064
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:42,418
- I will not tolerate this
assault on the house of God!
- Silence, you old fool!

1065
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:45,379
The hunchback and I
have unfinished business to attend to.

1066
01:17:45,462 --> 01:17:48,632
And this time
you will not interfere.

1067
01:17:50,759 --> 01:17:53,888
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!

1068
01:17:53,971 --> 01:17:55,931
Come and see.

1069
01:17:59,018 --> 01:18:02,354
Esmeralda, wake up.
You're safe now.

1070
01:18:04,231 --> 01:18:06,108
Esmeralda?

1071
01:18:07,943 --> 01:18:10,404
Oh, no.

1072
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:28,088
Oh, no.

1073
01:19:02,081 --> 01:19:06,835
- You killed her.
- It was my duty, horrible as it was.

1074
01:19:06,877 --> 01:19:10,506
I hope you will forgive me.

1075
01:19:10,589 --> 01:19:14,260
There, there, Quasimodo.
I know it hurts.

1076
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:16,679
But now the time has come...

1077
01:19:16,762 --> 01:19:20,683
to end your suffering...
forever.

1078
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:31,986
Now, now,

1079
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:34,363
listen to me, Quasimodo.

1080
01:19:34,405 --> 01:19:38,742
No, you listen! All my life,
you have told me the world
is a dark, cruel place.

1081
01:19:38,826 --> 01:19:43,414
But now I see that the only thing dark
and cruel about it is people like you.

1082
01:19:43,497 --> 01:19:46,500
- Quasimodo?
- Esmeralda!

1083
01:19:46,584 --> 01:19:49,628
- She lives.
- No!

1084
01:20:09,857 --> 01:20:14,820
Leaving so soon?

1085
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,699
Look, up there!

1086
01:20:18,782 --> 01:20:21,160
Hang on!

1087
01:20:34,798 --> 01:20:38,385
I should have known you'd risk your life
to save that Gypsy witch,

1088
01:20:38,469 --> 01:20:42,348
just as your own mother died
trying to save you.

1089
01:20:42,431 --> 01:20:44,350
What?

1090
01:20:44,433 --> 01:20:48,020
Now I'm going to do what I should
have done 20 years ago!

1091
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:54,777
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Oh!

1092
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:10,125
Hold on. Hold on.

1093
01:21:18,842 --> 01:21:21,220
And He shall
smite the wicked...

1094
01:21:21,303 --> 01:21:25,182
and plunge them
into the fiery pit!

1095
01:21:41,323 --> 01:21:43,701
Quasimodo! Quasi!

1096
01:21:43,784 --> 01:21:46,287
No!

1097
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:47,408
Three cheers...

1098
01:23:47,491 --> 01:23:51,453
