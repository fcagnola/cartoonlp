2
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,900
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,700
The winner, by total annihilation...

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,629
Yama!

5
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,941
Who is next?

6
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,140
Who has the guts to step into
the ring with Little Yama?

7
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,149
Yama!

8
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,708
Can I try?

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,104
I have a robot. I built it myself.

10
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,066
Beat it, kid.

11
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,985
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

12
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,420
Is this enough?

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,471
What's your name, little boy?

14
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,268
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

15
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,068
Prepare your bot, Zero.

16
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,510
Two bots enter,

17
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,700
one bot leaves.

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,901
Fighters ready?

19
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,261
Fight!

20
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,266
That was my first fight.
I... Can I try again?

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,310
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

22
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,190
Go home.

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,825
I've got more money.

24
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,304
Fighters ready?

25
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,951
Fight!

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,222
Mega-bot, destroy.

27
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,786
What?

28
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,591
- No more Little Yama.
- But, wha...

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,390
This is not possible!

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,188
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

31
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,751
Beginner's luck.

32
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,267
Do you want to go again, Yama?

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,222
- No one hustles Yama!
- Whoa. Hey...

34
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,828
Teach him a lesson.

35
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,946
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

36
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,909
- Hiro! Get on!
- Tadashi!

37
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,541
Good timing!

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,781
Oh, mama!

39
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,540
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,866
- Are you hurt?
- No.

41
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,944
Then what were you thinking,
knucklehead?

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,660
You graduated high school
when you were 13,

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,700
and this is what you're doing?

44
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,901
There they are!

45
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,141
Hey!

46
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,463
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,701
Yes!

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,271
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,340
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,224
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,380
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,820
Betting on bot fighting,
that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,101
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,583
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,581
Oh, no.

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,901
Hi, Aunt Cass.

57
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,989
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

58
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,580
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,906
Oh, good.

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,949
Then what were you
two knuckleheads thinking?

61
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,380
For 10 years,

62
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,582
I have done the best I could
to raise you.

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,471
Have I been perfect? No.

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,509
Do I know anything about children? No.

65
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,424
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?

66
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,660
Probably!

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,100
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,302
- Sorry.
- We love you, Aunt Cass.

69
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,871
Well, I love you, too!

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,949
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.

71
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,262
On beat poetry night.

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,025
Stress eating. Because of you.

73
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,264
Come on, Mochi.

74
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,464
This is really good!

75
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,260
You better make this up to Aunt Cass
before she eats everything in the cafe.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,500
For sure.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,861
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.

78
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,951
Absolutely.

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,780
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,301
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.

81
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,140
When are you gonna start doing something

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,705
with that big brain of yours?

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,630
What? Go to college like you?

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,504
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,347
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,983
What would Mom and Dad say?

87
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,180
I don't know.

88
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,900
They're gone.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,306
They died when I was three, remember?

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,621
Hey!

91
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,062
- I'll take you.
- Really?

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,340
I can't stop you from going,

93
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,826
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,107
Sweet.

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,828
What are we doing at your nerd school?

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,505
Bot-fight's that way!

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,071
Gotta grab something.

98
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,746
Is this gonna take long?

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,227
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,871
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,670
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

102
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,941
Heads up!

103
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,591
Electro-mag suspension?

104
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,901
Hey!

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,180
- Who are you?
- I'm...

106
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,303
Go Go, this is my brother Hiro.

107
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,943
Welcome to the nerd lab.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,701
Yeah.

109
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,591
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.

110
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,261
Zero resistance, faster bike.

111
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,104
But, not fast enough...

112
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,666
yet.

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,103
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,902
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,506
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

116
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,581
Catch.

117
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,627
Wow.

118
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,581
- Laser-induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,541
With a little magnetic confinement
for ultra-precision.

120
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,749
Wow. How do you find anything
in this mess?

121
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,620
I have a system.

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,820
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

123
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,351
- Need this!
- You can't do that!

124
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,582
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,420
Excuse me!

126
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,031
Coming through!

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,706
Tadashi!

128
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,780
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,984
I've heard so much about you!

130
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,269
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

131
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,824
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

132
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,540
400 pounds of it!

133
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,946
Come here, come here, come here.

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,705
You're going to love this.

135
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,989
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

136
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,620
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

137
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,300
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,782
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

139
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,300
It's so pink.

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,224
Here's the best part.

141
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,984
I know, right?

142
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,349
Chemical metal embrittlement.

143
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,985
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,820
"Honey Lemon"? "Go Go"? "Wasabi"?

145
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,990
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.

146
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,500
One time!

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,700
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,340
Who's Fred?

149
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,871
This guy, right here!

150
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,540
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

151
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,180
This is not my real face and body.

152
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,380
The name's Fred.

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,504
School mascot by day, but by night...

154
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,585
I am also a school mascot.

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,185
So, what's your major?

156
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,666
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

157
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,864
But I am a major science enthusiast.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,068
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,190
that can turn me into
a fire-breathing lizard at will.

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,627
But she says that's "not science."

161
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,861
It's really not.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

163
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,500
I asked Wasabi for
isn't "science" either.

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,700
- Is it?
- Nope.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,585
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

166
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,780
- Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich,

167
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,740
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

168
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,940
Just stop.

169
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,260
- Laser eyes?
- What?

170
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,180
- Tingly fingers?
- Never gonna happen.

171
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,427
Hey, what about a growth serum?

172
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,543
So, what have you been working on?

173
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,861
I'll show you.

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,980
Duct tape?

175
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,940
I hate to break it to you, bro.

176
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,266
Already been invented.

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,540
Hey!

178
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,700
Dude!

179
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,901
Ow!

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,107
This is what I've been working on.

181
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,622
Hello. I am Baymax.

182
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,181
Your personal healthcare companion.

183
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,580
I was alerted to the need

184
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,102
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

185
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,422
A robotic nurse.

186
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,422
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

187
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,430
Physical or emotional?

188
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,786
I will scan you now.

189
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,109
Scan complete.

190
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,822
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

191
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,541
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

192
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,184
What's in the spray, specifically?

193
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,300
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

194
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,946
That's a bummer.
I'm actually allergic to that.

195
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,029
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

196
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,348
You do have a mild allergy to

197
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,540
peanuts.

198
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,310
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,940
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,144
Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

201
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,827
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

202
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,580
Vinyl?

203
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,909
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,140
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,751
- No offense.
- I am a robot.

206
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,141
I cannot be offended.

207
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,347
- Hyperspectral cameras?
- Yep.

208
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,029
- Titanium skeleton?
- Carbon fiber.

209
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,388
Right. Even lighter.

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,827
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,540
Machined them right here, in-house.

212
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,980
- Really?
- Yup.

213
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,620
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

214
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,821
Shut up.

215
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,503
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

216
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,866
Nice.

217
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,425
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,431
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

219
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,589
He's going to help a lot of people.

220
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,660
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

221
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,861
Lithium ion.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,706
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

223
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,820
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

224
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,021
Hey, Professor.

225
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,069
Actually, I was just finishing up.

226
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,387
You must be Hiro.

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,031
Bot-fighter, right?

228
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,867
When my daughter was younger,
that's all she wanted to do.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,100
May I?

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,586
Sure.

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,070
Magnetic-bearing servos.

232
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,426
Pretty sick, huh?

233
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,741
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

234
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,306
Hey, genius!

235
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,269
He invented them.

236
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,747
You're Robert Callaghan?

237
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,500
Like, as in,

238
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,429
the Callaghan-Catmull spline,

239
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,060
and Callaghan's "Laws of Robotics?"

240
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,140
That's right.

241
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,104
Ever think about applying here?

242
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,666
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

243
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,780
I don't know.

244
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,223
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

245
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,740
Well, kind of serious.

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,900
I can see why.

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,068
With your bot, winning must come easy.

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,990
Yeah, I guess.

249
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,510
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.

250
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,981
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

251
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,627
My students go on to shape the future.

252
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,420
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

253
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,031
Good luck with the bot-fights.

254
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,946
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.

255
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,660
I have to go here.

256
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,340
If I don't go to this nerd school,

257
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,826
I'm gonna lose my mind.

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,226
How do I get in?

259
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,189
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

260
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,820
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.

261
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,704
But, it's gotta be great.

262
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,101
Trust me.

263
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,311
It will be.

264
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,580
Nothing!

265
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,989
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

266
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,180
Wow. Washed up at 14.

267
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,380
So sad.

268
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,311
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.

269
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,305
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,346
What are you doing?

271
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,826
Shake things up.

272
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,301
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

273
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,508
- What?
- Look for a new angle.

274
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,180
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

275
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,500
How are you feeling?

276
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,140
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

277
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,422
Yep, he's nervous.

278
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,866
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

279
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,705
- He's so tense.
- No, I'm not.

280
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,340
Relax, Hiro.

281
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,305
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go Go.

282
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,582
- Stop whining. Woman up.
- I'm fine!

283
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?

284
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,701
Fresh pair of underpants?

285
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,780
Underpants? You need serious help.

286
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,981
Hey, I come prepared.

287
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,109
I haven't done laundry in six months.

288
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,387
One pair lasts me four days.

289
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,901
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.

290
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,744
Then I go front and back.

291
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,142
Wow. That is both
disgusting and awesome.

292
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,506
Don't encourage him.

293
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,060
It's called "recycling."

294
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,831
Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.

295
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh, yeah. This is it.

296
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,820
I guess I'm up.

297
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."

298
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,825
- Hiro!
- Yeah!

299
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,586
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

300
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,185
- Don't mess it up.
- Break a leg, little man.

301
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,791
Science, yeah!

302
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,108
All right, bro. This is it.

303
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,668
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

304
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,740
What's going on?

305
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,307
I really want to go here.

306
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,981
Hey.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,102
You got this.

308
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,780
Hi.

309
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,263
My name is Hiro...

310
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,906
Sorry.

311
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,740
My name is Hiro Hamada,

312
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,309
and I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.

313
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,304
I hope you like it.

314
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,144
This is a microbot.

315
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,423
Breathe.

316
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,620
It doesn't look like much,

317
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,027
but when it links up
with the rest of its pals...

318
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,511
things get a little more interesting.

319
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,902
The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.

320
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,501
I think what I want them to do...

321
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,546
They do it.

322
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,860
The applications for this tech
are limitless.

323
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,505
Construction.

324
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,340
What used to take teams
of people working by hand

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,746
for months or years,

326
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,551
can now be accomplished by one person.

327
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,030
And that's just the beginning.

328
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,750
How about transportation?

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,380
Microbots can move anything anywhere,

330
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,184
with ease.

331
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,543
If you can think it,
the microbots can do it.

332
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,581
The only limit is your imagination.

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,909
Microbots!

334
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,391
That's my nephew!

335
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,667
Yes!

336
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,466
My family! I love my family!

337
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,266
Nailed it!

338
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,269
- You did it!
- Not bad!

339
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,270
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

340
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,741
They loved you. That was amazing!

341
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,260
Yes.

342
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,545
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.

343
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,825
Alistair Krei!

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,427
May I?

345
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,108
Extraordinary.

346
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,460
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

347
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,150
Shut up.

348
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,825
Mr. Krei is right.

349
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,825
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,630
You can continue to develop them,

351
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,220
or you can sell them to a man

352
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,502
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.

353
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,420
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

354
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,620
but it shouldn't affect...

355
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,460
This is your decision, Hiro.

356
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,540
But you should know

357
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,620
Mr. Krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science

358
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,821
to get where he is.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,980
That's just not true.

360
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,865
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech
with your microbots,

361
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,460
or anything else.

362
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,030
Hiro, I'm offering you more money
than any 14-year-old could imagine.

363
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,463
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,
but they're not for sale.

364
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,389
I thought you were smarter than that.

365
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,945
Robert.

366
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,031
Mr. Krei.

367
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,391
That's my brother's.

368
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,824
That's right.

369
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,189
I look forward to seeing you in class.

370
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,820
Unbelievable!

371
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,980
That's what I'm talking about.

372
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,300
All right, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.

373
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,501
Back to the café!

374
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,820
Dinner is on me!

375
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,863
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

376
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,860
- Aunt Cass?
- Unless it's moldy.

377
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,346
We'll... We'll catch up, okay?

378
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,620
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

379
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,584
Both of you.

380
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,902
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

381
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,265
I know what you're going to say.

382
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,180
"I should be proud of myself,"

383
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,111
"because I'm finally using my gift
for something important."

384
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,020
No, no. I was just gonna tell you
your fly was down for the whole show.

385
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,109
Ha-ha-hilarious.

386
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,071
What?

387
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,106
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

388
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,431
Hey, I, um...

389
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,385
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So,

390
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,425
you know,

391
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,425
thanks for not giving up on me.

392
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you okay?

393
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,745
Yeah. I'm okay.

394
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,546
But Professor Callaghan
is still in there.

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,431
Tadashi, no!

396
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,390
Callaghan's in there.

397
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,782
Someone has to help.

398
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,784
Tadashi!

399
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,469
Tadashi!

400
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,024
Here. Have some tea.

401
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,224
Hey, sweetie.

402
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,661
Hey, Aunt Cass.

403
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,584
Mrs. Matsuda's in the café.

404
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,067
She's wearing something
super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

405
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,385
That always cracks you up.

406
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,583
You should come down.

407
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,950
Maybe later.

408
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,025
The university called again.

409
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,264
It's been a few weeks
since classes started.

410
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,702
But they said
it's not too late to register.

411
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,469
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

412
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,941
Hey, Hiro.

413
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,831
We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.

414
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,061
We wish you were here, buddy.

415
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,105
Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,

416
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,661
it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,

417
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,106
and give you a big hug.

418
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,821
Ow!

419
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,022
Hello. I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

420
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,980
Hey, Baymax.

421
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,860
I didn't know you were still active.

422
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,020
I heard a sound of distress.

423
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,620
What seems to be the trouble?

424
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,700
I just stubbed my toe a little.

425
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,106
I'm fine.

426
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,182
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

427
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,181
A zero. I'm okay, really.

428
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,263
Thanks. You can shrink now.

429
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,951
Does it hurt when I touch it?

430
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,860
That's okay. No touching.

431
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,585
I'm fine...

432
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,421
Ow.

433
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,020
You have fallen.

434
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,221
You think?

435
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,706
- On a scale of 1 to...
- Ow!

436
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,980
On a scale...

437
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,261
On a sca...

438
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,582
On a scale of 1 to 10...

439
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,262
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,060
Zero.

441
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,422
- It is all right to cry.
- No. No, no, no, no.

442
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,180
Crying is a natural response to pain.

443
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm not crying.

444
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,900
- I will scan you for injuries.
- Don't scan me.

445
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,740
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable.

446
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,749
You have sustained no injuries.

447
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,426
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels

448
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,380
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings

449
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,786
common in adolescence.

450
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,421
Diagnosis, puberty.

451
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,741
What?

452
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,347
Okay. Time to shrink now.

453
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,469
You should expect an increase
in body hair,

454
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,102
especially on your face,
chest, armpits, and...

455
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,466
Thank you! That's enough.

456
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,271
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.

457
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,264
Okay! Let's get you
back in your luggage.

458
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,425
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

459
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,106
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

460
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,470
My microbot?

461
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,940
This doesn't make any sense.

462
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,340
Puberty can often be a confusing time

463
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,622
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.

464
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,620
No. The thing is attracted
to the other microbots,

465
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,580
but that's impossible.

466
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,782
They were destroyed in the fire.

467
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,987
Dumb thing's broken.

468
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,100
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

469
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,260
Oh, yeah?

470
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,986
Why don't you find out
where it's trying to go?

471
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,666
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?

472
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,185
Absolutely.

473
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,146
Baymax?

474
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

475
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,626
Baymax?

476
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,346
What?

477
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,462
- Hiro?
- Hey, Aunt Cass!

478
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,861
Wow. You're up and...

479
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,860
Yeah! I figured it was time.

480
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,820
Are you registering for school?

481
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,021
Yes.

482
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,910
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.

483
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,347
Oh, honey, that's so great.

484
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,820
Okay,

485
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,226
special dinner tonight.

486
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,740
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

487
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,387
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.

488
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,230
- Okay, sounds good.
- Great!

489
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,860
Last hug.

490
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,026
Baymax!

491
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,186
- Baymax!
- Hey!

492
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,461
Watch it!

493
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,741
Baymax!

494
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,226
Baymax!

495
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,060
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

496
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,831
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.

497
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,431
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...

498
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,631
Locked.

499
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,828
There is a window.

500
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,788
Please exercise caution.

501
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,341
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.

502
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,301
Oh, no.

503
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,301
Excuse me while I let out some air.

504
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,541
Are you done?

505
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,301
Yes.

506
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,029
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

507
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,621
Fine, just keep it down.

508
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,504
My microbots?

509
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,061
Someone's making more.

510
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,266
Hiro?

511
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,700
You gave me a heart attack!

512
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,063
My hands are equipped
with defibrillators. Clear.

513
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,901
Stop, stop, stop!
It's just an expression.

514
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,263
Oh, no.

515
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,586
Run!

516
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,750
Oh, come on!

517
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,140
I am not fast.

518
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no kidding!

519
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,540
Go! Go! Come on.

520
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,980
Kick it down!

521
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,908
Then punch it!

522
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,066
Go! Go!

523
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,428
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

524
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,747
Move it!

525
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,746
Come on!

526
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,268
No, no.

527
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,342
Come on! The window!

528
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,426
Suck it in!

529
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,300
Baymax!

530
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,991
Hiro?

531
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,020
Come on, let's get out of here.

532
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,949
Go! Hurry!

533
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,068
All right, let me get this straight.

534
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,180
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

535
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,508
with an army of miniature flying robots.

536
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,141
"Microbots."

537
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,309
- Microbots.
- Yeah.

538
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,221
He was controlling them telepathically
with a neurocranial transmitter.

539
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,140
So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP

540
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,025
to attack you and balloon man.

541
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,784
Did you file a report
when your flying robots were stolen?

542
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,060
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

543
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,264
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but Baymax was there, too.

544
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,384
- Tell him.
- Yes, Officer.

545
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,424
He's telling the truth.

546
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,709
What the... What's wrong with you?

547
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,580
Low battery.

548
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,420
Try to keep it together.

549
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

550
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,220
Kid, how about we call your parents

551
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,582
- and get them down here?
- What?

552
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,222
Write your name and number down
on this piece of paper, and we can...

553
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,107
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.

554
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,060
Can you walk?

555
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,104
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

556
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,623
Healthcare.

557
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,740
Okay.

558
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,342
If my aunt asks,
we were at school all day. Got it?

559
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,821
We jumped out a window.

560
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,704
No! Quiet!

561
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,620
We jumped out a window.

562
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,983
You can't say things like that
around Aunt Cass.

563
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,260
Hiro?

564
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,621
You home, sweetie?

565
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,660
That's right.

566
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,306
I thought I heard you. Hi.

567
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,628
Hey, Aunt Cass.

568
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,860
Look at my little college man.

569
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,142
I can't wait to hear all about it!

570
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,420
And wings are almost ready.

571
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,460
Whee!

572
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,620
Will you be quiet?

573
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,630
Yeah, wings! Whee!

574
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,501
All right, get ready to have
your face melted.

575
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,580
We are gonna feel these things tomorrow.

576
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,140
You know what I'm saying?

577
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,260
Okay.

578
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,827
Sit down. Tell me everything.

579
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,542
The thing is that,
since I registered so late,

580
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,061
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.

581
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,546
What was that?

582
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,300
Mochi.

583
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,821
That darn cat.

584
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,507
At least take a plate
for the road, okay?

585
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,871
- Don't work too...
- Thanks for understanding.

586
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,070
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

587
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,220
All right, come on.

588
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,310
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

589
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,621
One foot in front of the other.

590
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,627
This doesn't make any sense.

591
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,144
Tadashi.

592
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,306
What?

593
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,950
Tadashi.

594
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,905
Tadashi's gone.

595
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,342
When will he return?

596
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,742
He's dead, Baymax.

597
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,586
Tadashi was in excellent health.

598
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,945
With a proper diet and exercise,
he should have lived a long life.

599
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,866
Yeah, he should have.

600
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,309
But there was a fire and...

601
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,511
Now, he's gone.

602
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,981
- Tadashi is here.
- No.

603
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,621
People keep saying he's not really gone.

604
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,103
As long as we remember him.

605
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,620
It still hurts.

606
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,620
I see no evidence of physical injury.

607
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,504
It's a different kind of hurt.

608
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,780
You are my patient.

609
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,300
I would like to help.

610
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,471
You can't fix this one, buddy.

611
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,341
What are you doing?

612
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,709
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.

613
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,380
Database downloaded.

614
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,982
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.

615
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,500
I am contacting them now.

616
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,140
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

617
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,540
Your friends have been contacted.

618
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,504
Unbelievable.

619
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,387
Now, what are you doing?

620
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,341
Other treatments include
compassion and physical reassurance.

621
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,820
I'm okay. Really.

622
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,109
You will be all right. There, there.

623
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,751
Thanks, Baymax.

624
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,382
I am sorry about the fire.

625
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,510
It's okay. It was an accident.

626
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,826
Unless...

627
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,144
Unless it wasn't.

628
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,620
At the showcase,

629
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,300
that guy in the mask
stole my microbots. And...

630
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,020
And then set the fire
to cover his tracks.

631
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,110
He's responsible for Tadashi.

632
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,549
We gotta catch that guy.

633
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,740
It's alive!

634
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,387
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

635
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,746
If we're gonna catch that guy,

636
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,545
you need some upgrades.

637
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,310
Will apprehending the man in the mask
improve your emotional state?

638
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,144
Absolutely.

639
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,946
Let's work on your moves.

640
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,061
Now, let's take care of this.

641
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,023
I have some concerns.

642
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,026
This armor may undermine
my non-threatening, huggable design.

643
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,820
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

644
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,067
You look sick.

645
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,261
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

646
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,985
It's just an expression.

647
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,262
Data transfer complete.

648
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,903
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.

649
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,582
You want to keep me healthy, don't you?

650
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,946
Punch this.

651
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,823
Yes! Hammerfist!

652
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,581
Side kick!

653
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,946
Knifehand!

654
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,460
Back kick!

655
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,661
Gummy bears!

656
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,107
Yes!

657
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,310
Yeah! Fist bump!

658
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,180
"Fist bump" is not in
my fighting database.

659
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,788
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

660
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,102
It's what people do sometimes

661
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,907
when they're excited or pumped up.

662
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,065
Hey, now you're getting it.

663
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,746
I will add "fist bump"
to my care-giving matrix.

664
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,261
All right. Let's go get that guy.

665
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,345
Come on!

666
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,351
Get him, Baymax!

667
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,749
We're too late.

668
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,503
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

669
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,425
Come on.

670
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,863
Always wait one hour after eating
before swimming.

671
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,221
Hey!

672
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,385
Come on!

673
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,385
Your heart rate has
increased dramatic...

674
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,022
Okay, Baymax,
time to use those upgrades.

675
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,431
- Hiro?
- No, no, no!

676
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,866
Get out of here! Go!

677
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,620
Dude, what are you doing out here?

678
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,266
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

679
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,104
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

680
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,387
Is that Baymax?

681
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,145
Yeah, but you really...

682
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,946
Why is he wearing
carbon fiber underpants?

683
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,705
I also know karate.

684
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,900
You guys need to go.

685
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,070
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.

686
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,745
That's why Baymax contacted us.

687
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,220
Those who suffer a loss,

688
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,620
require support
from friends and loved ones.

689
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,740
Okay, but I...

690
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,780
Who would like
to share their feelings first?

691
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,470
I'll go. Okay.

692
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,101
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...

693
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,984
Holy mother of Megazon!

694
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,908
Am I the only one seeing this?

695
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,225
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

696
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,940
Go!

697
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,585
Baymax, get him!

698
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,064
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

699
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,500
I'm saving your life.

700
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,907
Baymax can handle that guy!

701
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,461
Oh, no.

702
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,380
Wasabi!

703
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,105
Goodbye!

704
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,020
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

705
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,860
He stole my microbots.
He started the fire.

706
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,505
I don't know who he is!

707
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,221
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

708
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,421
Hard left!

709
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,981
That mask, the black suit...

710
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,302
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!

711
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,060
I mean, how cool is that?

712
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,342
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!

713
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,780
Why are we stopped?

714
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,981
The light's red!

715
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,621
There are no red lights in a car chase!

716
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,590
Why is he trying to kill us?

717
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,948
Why are you trying to kill us?

718
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,665
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!

719
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,311
Let's not jump to conclusions.

720
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,304
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

721
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,420
Car!

722
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,951
He's trying to kill us!

723
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,305
Did you just put your blinker on?

724
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,860
You have to indicate your turn!

725
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,186
It's the law!

726
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,224
That's it.

727
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,940
Stop the car!

728
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,301
Baymax and I can take this guy!

729
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,630
Seatbelts save lives.

730
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,271
Buckle up, every time.

731
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,102
What are you doing? What are you doing?

732
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,828
- Did we lose him?
- Look out!

733
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,426
Baymax, hold on!

734
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,226
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

735
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,224
We made it! Yes!

736
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,788
I told you we'd make it!

737
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,980
Your injuries require my attention.

738
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,228
And your body temperatures are low.

739
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,947
We should get out of here.

740
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,989
I know a place.

741
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,031
Where are we?

742
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,871
Fred.

743
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,340
Where are you going?

744
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,510
Welcome to mi casa.

745
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,344
That's French for "front door."

746
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,184
It's really not.

747
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,501
Listen, nitwit.

748
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,186
A lunatic in a mask
just tried to kill us.

749
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,785
I'm not in the mood for any...

750
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,462
Welcome home, Master Frederick.

751
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,350
Heathcliff, my man!

752
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,822
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

753
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,107
Gimme some.

754
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,951
Freddie,

755
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,940
this is your house?

756
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,904
I thought you lived under a bridge.

757
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,949
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.

758
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,229
They're on a vacay on the family island.

759
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,826
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.

760
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,630
You gotta be kidding me.

761
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,465
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

762
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,141
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

763
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,387
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

764
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,985
Your body temperature is still low.

765
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,026
Yeah.

766
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,500
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

767
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,429
It's so nice.

768
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,264
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

769
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,068
Good robot.

770
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,868
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

771
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,064
- Yes! It's a bird!
- No!

772
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,500
The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.

773
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,829
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

774
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,585
Apprehend him?

775
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,100
We don't even know who he is.

776
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,865
I have a theory.

777
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,903
"Dr. Slaughter, MD"?

778
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,100
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

779
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,631
Malcolm Chazzletick.

780
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,020
"The Annihilator"?

781
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,906
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

782
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,108
"Baron von Destruct"?
Just get to the point!

783
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,461
Don't you guys get it?

784
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,860
The man in the mask who attacked us

785
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,471
is none other than...

786
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,060
Voila!

787
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,466
Alistair Krei.

788
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,190
- What?
- Think about it.

789
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,787
Krei wanted your microbots,
and you said no.

790
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,421
But rules don't apply
to a man like Krei.

791
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,471
There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

792
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,504
Then who was that guy in the mask?

793
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,220
I don't know.

794
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,502
We don't know anything about him.

795
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,981
His blood type is AB-negative.

796
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,506
Cholesterol levels are...

797
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,827
Baymax, you scanned him?

798
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,900
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

799
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,465
Yes!

800
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,980
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

801
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,831
You'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

802
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,984
That might take, I don't know, forever.

803
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,580
No, no, no, no. I...

804
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,862
I just have to look for another angle.

805
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,507
Got it!

806
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,708
I'll scan the whole city
at the same time.

807
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,227
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

808
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,143
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

809
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,709
I need to upgrade all of you.

810
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,027
Upgrade who, now?

811
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,620
Those who suffer a loss require support
from friends and loved ones.

812
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,221
Okay, I like where this is heading!

813
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,906
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

814
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,471
Hiro, we want to help,

815
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,629
but we're just us.

816
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,940
No.

817
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,303
You can be way more.

818
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,825
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

819
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,945
We're in.

820
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,548
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?

821
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,623
Our origin story begins.

822
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,942
We're gonna be superheroes!

823
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,026
Arms up.

824
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,423
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

825
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,700
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.

826
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,980
Game over.

827
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,060
They say
"We are what we are"

828
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,944
But we don't have to be

829
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,909
I'm bad behavior

830
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,666
But I do it in the best way

831
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,908
I'll be the watcher

832
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,625
Of the eternal flame

833
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,182
I'll be the guard dog

834
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,184
Of all your fever dreams

835
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,787
I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass

836
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,706
'Cause we could be immortals

837
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,861
Immortals

838
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,420
Just not for long

839
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,622
For long

840
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,305
Live with me forever now

841
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,668
Pull the blackout curtains down

842
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,942
Just not for long
For long

843
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,941
We could be immortals

844
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,630
Immortals

845
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,222
Immortals

846
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,700
Immortals

847
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,860
Sometimes the only payoff

848
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,267
For having any faith

849
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,540
Is when it's tested again

850
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,026
And again
Every day

851
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,020
I'm still comparing your past

852
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,188
To my future

853
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,908
'Cause we could be immortals

854
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,751
Immortals

855
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,790
Just not for long
For long

856
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,580
Super Jump!

857
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,740
Super Jump!

858
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,900
And live with me forever now

859
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,540
Pull the blackout curtains down

860
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,500
- I breathe fire.
- Just not for long

861
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,781
For long

862
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,350
We could be immortals
Immortals

863
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,547
Immortals

864
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,704
Immortals

865
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,070
Immortals

866
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,505
Immortals

867
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,545
Immortals

868
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,588
Immortals

869
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,100
I love it!

870
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,420
Not bad.

871
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,300
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

872
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,547
Hey, guys!

873
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,624
Check this out.

874
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,305
I'd like to introduce,

875
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,430
Baymax 2.0.

876
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,942
He's glorious.

877
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,505
Hello.

878
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,587
Hold up. Focus.

879
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,982
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

880
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,427
The fist, show them the fist.

881
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,584
No, not that.

882
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,505
The thing, the other thing.

883
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,823
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

884
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,382
That's just one of his new upgrades!

885
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,304
Baymax, wings.

886
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,148
No way!

887
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,790
Thrusters.

888
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,340
I fail to see how flying

889
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,463
makes me a better healthcare companion.

890
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,749
I fail to see how you fail to see
that it's awesome!

891
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,306
Full thrust.

892
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,701
Steady, big guy.

893
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,540
Look, let's just take this slow.

894
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,740
Up, up, up, up, up!

895
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,226
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

896
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,980
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

897
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,625
Too much thrust!

898
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,060
No, no, no, no!

899
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,307
Back on! Back on!

900
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,706
On! On! On!

901
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,711
Zoom...

902
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,260
Go up! Up, up, up!

903
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,461
Up!

904
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,860
Oh, man!

905
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,028
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.

906
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,344
What do you say?

907
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,151
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.

908
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,621
Which means what?

909
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,263
The treatment is working.

910
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,831
Oh, no!

911
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,380
No, no, no, no, no!

912
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,344
Whoa, Baymax!

913
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,061
Yes!

914
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,981
Yeah!

915
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,266
Yes!

916
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,101
Wow!

917
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,221
That was...

918
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,345
That was...

919
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,026
Sick.

920
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,227
It is just an expression.

921
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,462
That's... That's right, buddy.

922
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,305
I am never taking the bus again.

923
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,385
Your emotional state has improved.

924
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,421
I can deactivate if you say
you are satisfied with your care.

925
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,345
What?

926
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,184
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

927
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,780
We still have to find that guy.

928
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,982
So, fire up that super-sensor.

929
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,150
Functionality improved.

930
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,270
1000% increase in range.

931
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,781
I have found a match...

932
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,949
on that island.

933
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,548
- Killer view.
- Yeah. If I...

934
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,660
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

935
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,860
I'd probably love this.

936
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,461
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

937
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,189
There. Baymax, take us in.

938
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,780
Awesome!

939
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,221
Our first landing together as a team.

940
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,189
Guys, come on.

941
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,467
"Quarantine"?

942
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,351
Do you people know
what "quarantine" means?

943
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,463
"Quarantine." Enforced isolation

944
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,820
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,

945
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,660
or, in some cases, death.

946
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,100
There's a skull face on this one.

947
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,340
A skull face!

948
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,746
Be ready.

949
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,823
He could be anywhere.

950
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,990
Fire!

951
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,349
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

952
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,344
That was a bird.

953
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,907
Well, at least we know our gear works.

954
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,980
Six intrepid friends

955
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,420
Led by Fred

956
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,304
Their leader, Fred

957
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,781
Fred's Angels

958
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,382
Fred's Angels

959
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,540
Harnessing the power of the sun

960
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,142
With the ancient amulet
They found in the attic

961
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,660
The amulet is green

962
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,225
It's probably an emerald

963
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,588
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

964
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,225
Guys.

965
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,145
Any sign of him, Baymax?

966
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,391
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.

967
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,107
Perfect. The robot's broken.

968
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,586
Guys, you might want to see this.

969
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,942
What do you think it is, genius?

970
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,791
I'm not sure. But look.

971
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,581
Hiro.

972
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,191
Krei.

973
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,740
That's right.

974
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,300
We were asked to do the impossible.

975
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,501
That's what we did.

976
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,386
We've reinvented
the very concept of transportation.

977
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,148
Friends, I present
Project Silent Sparrow.

978
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,381
General, may I?

979
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,665
Magic hat!

980
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,900
Teleportation.

981
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,910
The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.

982
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,230
Not science fiction anymore.

983
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,340
Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars

984
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,746
to teleport hats.

985
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,822
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.

986
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,665
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

987
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,500
We've invited all these people.

988
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,350
Might as well give 'em a show.

989
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,231
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

990
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,500
- 29... 28...
- This is Argo.

991
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,300
- Capsule's in position.
- 27...

992
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,180
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.

993
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,190
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

994
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,751
No. No problem.

995
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,340
It's well within the parameters.

996
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,871
Let's move forward.

997
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,820
3... 2... 1...

998
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,545
Cabin pressure is go.

999
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,589
Pod engaged.

1000
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,704
Field breach! Abort!

1001
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,102
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1002
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,467
Oh, no.

1003
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,986
- It's breaking up!
- The pilot is gone.

1004
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,150
Portal two is down.

1005
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,310
The magnetic containment field's down!

1006
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,583
Krei, shut it down now!

1007
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,270
I want this island sealed off!

1008
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,304
The government shut down
Krei's experiment.

1009
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,265
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

1010
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,429
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1011
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,311
Oh, no.

1012
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,542
Baymax, get us out of here.

1013
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,941
Go for the transmitter.

1014
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,591
Behind his mask.

1015
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,467
Baymax!

1016
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,621
All right, what's the plan?

1017
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,146
It's Fred time.

1018
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,266
Super Jump!

1019
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,947
Gravity Crush!

1020
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,469
Falling hard.

1021
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,266
Seriously, what is the plan?

1022
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,827
- Get the mask.
- Right behind you.

1023
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,028
For real, what is the plan?

1024
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,467
Hey!

1025
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,941
Hey!

1026
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,824
You want to dance, masked man?

1027
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,710
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1028
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,830
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!

1029
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,101
And a little bit of that!

1030
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,509
Hey! I did all right.

1031
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,590
Is that all you got?

1032
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,189
You got that, too?

1033
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,341
It's back into the fire!

1034
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,230
It's over, Krei.

1035
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,308
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1036
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,749
The explosion...

1037
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,061
You died.

1038
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,746
No. I had your microbots.

1039
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,750
But, Tadashi.

1040
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,981
You just let him die.

1041
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,427
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1042
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,100
He went in there to save you!

1043
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,586
That was his mistake!

1044
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,742
Baymax, destroy.

1045
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,190
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.

1046
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,626
Not anymore.

1047
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,623
Hiro, this is not what...

1048
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,461
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1049
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,945
No! Stop, Baymax!

1050
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,827
No, stop! He's getting away!

1051
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,669
Baymax!

1052
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,021
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.

1053
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,826
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1054
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,340
How could you do that? I had him!

1055
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,340
What you just did,
we never signed up for.

1056
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,668
We said we'd catch the guy.

1057
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,901
That's it.

1058
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,029
I never should have let you help me!

1059
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,024
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1060
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,148
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

1061
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,626
Wings.

1062
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,020
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1063
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,540
Fly!

1064
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,310
Hiro!

1065
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,708
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1066
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,109
You appear to be distressed.

1067
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,830
I'm fine!

1068
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,831
There. Is it working?

1069
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,751
- My sensor is operational.
- Good.

1070
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,591
Then let's get...

1071
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,226
What?

1072
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,580
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?

1073
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,430
Yes. Open!

1074
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,420
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.

1075
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,622
Baymax, open your access port.

1076
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,428
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

1077
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,583
Just open!

1078
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,468
Will terminating Professor Callaghan
improve your emotional state?

1079
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,828
Yes! No! I don't know!

1080
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,101
Open your access!

1081
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,581
- Is this what Tadashi wanted?
- It doesn't matter!

1082
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,021
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1083
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,423
Tadashi's gone!

1084
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,301
Tadashi's gone.

1085
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,423
Tadashi is here.

1086
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,983
No. He's not here.

1087
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,026
Tadashi is here.

1088
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,027
This is Tadashi Hamada.

1089
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,861
And this is the first test
of my robotics project.

1090
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,381
Hello, I am Baymax.

1091
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,190
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1092
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,304
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1093
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,706
Hello, I...

1094
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,064
What? What?

1095
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,349
Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan! Stop...

1096
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,980
Tadashi Hamada again,

1097
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,344
and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.

1098
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,023
I'm not giving up on you.

1099
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,831
You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.

1100
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,664
So, let's get back to work.

1101
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,991
This is Tadashi Hamada,

1102
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,589
and this is the 84th test.

1103
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,390
What do you say, big guy?

1104
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,980
Hello, I am Baymax,

1105
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,103
your personal healthcare companion.

1106
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,380
It works.

1107
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,660
It works!

1108
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,431
This is amazing! You... You work!

1109
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,028
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1110
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,340
I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...

1111
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,941
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1112
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,350
Scan me.

1113
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,231
Your neurotransmitter
levels are elevated.

1114
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,548
This indicates that you are happy.

1115
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,067
I am. I really am.

1116
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,107
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1117
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,021
You're gonna help so many people, buddy.

1118
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,790
So many.

1119
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,701
That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.

1120
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,742
Thank you, Baymax.

1121
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,789
I'm so sorry.

1122
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,501
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1123
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,511
Hiro.

1124
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,991
Guys, I... I...

1125
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,907
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1126
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,308
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1127
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,189
But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1128
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,140
- Oh, man.
- Nah, it's cool.

1129
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,420
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.

1130
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,351
Hiro, we found something you should see.

1131
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,706
You almost got us all killed!

1132
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,022
Krei! You did this!

1133
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,989
You knew it wasn't ready!

1134
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,942
Callaghan? He was there?

1135
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,184
He was such a good man. What happened?

1136
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,620
I don't know.

1137
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,629
But the answer's here somewhere.

1138
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,303
Wait, wait! Stop.

1139
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,110
There he is.

1140
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,942
With the pilot.

1141
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,340
Hang on.

1142
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,470
We've invited all these people...

1143
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,663
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1144
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,903
Callaghan blames Krei.

1145
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,507
This is a revenge story.

1146
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,589
So, what are we waiting for?

1147
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,671
It's all set up.

1148
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,308
This beautiful new campus
is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1149
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,068
But none of this would've been possible

1150
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,547
without a few bumps in the road.

1151
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,180
Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path

1152
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,506
to a bright future.

1153
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,066
What is that?

1154
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,550
- What?
- Setback?

1155
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,427
Was my daughter a "setback"?

1156
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,862
Callaghan! But you...

1157
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,941
Your daughter, that...

1158
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,420
That was an accident.

1159
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,540
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1160
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,186
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.

1161
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,101
What are you doing?

1162
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,385
You took everything from me when
you sent Abigail into that machine.

1163
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,229
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1164
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,420
No!

1165
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,270
No! No! You can't!

1166
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,991
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.

1167
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,746
Then, it's your turn.

1168
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,630
Professor Callaghan!

1169
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,261
Let him go!

1170
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,260
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1171
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,144
Abigail is gone!

1172
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,464
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.

1173
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,350
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1174
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,500
Please, let me go.

1175
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,782
I'll give you anything you want!

1176
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,343
I want my daughter back!

1177
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,261
Go for the mask!

1178
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,460
Baymax!

1179
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,185
Leaping into action!

1180
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,665
Oh, no!

1181
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,504
Getting a little tight.

1182
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,702
- No!
- He's too strong!

1183
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,062
- There's no way out!
- You can't beat him!

1184
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,540
Help! I can't beat him.

1185
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,980
Hiro!

1186
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,387
- Hiro? Hiro?
- Help!

1187
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,060
- That's it!
- Hiro.

1188
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,546
- I know how to beat him.
- Hiro.

1189
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,587
Listen up!

1190
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,551
Use those big brains of yours
and think your way around the problem.

1191
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,110
Look for a new angle.

1192
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,226
My arms! They can't go any further!

1193
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,709
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1194
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,551
Hello, sign.

1195
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,020
Care to go for a little spin?

1196
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,745
Double spin!

1197
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,820
Behind-the-back spin!

1198
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,226
Yeah!

1199
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,781
Yeah!

1200
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,741
Baymax!

1201
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,750
Hiro.

1202
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,065
I love that robot!

1203
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,103
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1204
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,502
Take out the bots.
They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1205
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,140
Now that is a plan!

1206
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,388
Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?

1207
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,350
Like you have to ask.

1208
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,627
Let's do this, Freddie!

1209
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,540
Smokescreen!

1210
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,140
Ready and

1211
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,186
dive!

1212
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,100
Whoa, the gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!

1213
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,340
Wait.

1214
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,701
Let's use this!

1215
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,826
These are green blades of fury!

1216
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,745
Woman up!

1217
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,830
Double sign-spin.

1218
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,228
Now my signs are on fire!

1219
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,547
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1220
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,180
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1221
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,711
Hammerfist.

1222
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,391
This ends now!

1223
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,024
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1224
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,261
What?

1225
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,386
Baymax!

1226
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,227
No!

1227
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,141
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.

1228
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,747
But we'll take that.

1229
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,466
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1230
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,941
We can't!
The containment field is failing.

1231
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,342
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1232
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,264
We need to get out of here, now!

1233
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,780
Baymax!

1234
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,267
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1235
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,344
- What?
- Coming from there.

1236
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,300
The life signs are female.

1237
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,662
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1238
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,984
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1239
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,546
Abigail.

1240
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,386
Let's go get her.

1241
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,305
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.

1242
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,460
She's alive in there.

1243
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,310
Someone has to help.

1244
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,228
What do you say, buddy?

1245
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,111
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.

1246
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,861
Careful! There's Krei
Tech debris everywhere.

1247
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,071
Look out!

1248
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,390
I have located the patient.

1249
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,620
Hurry!

1250
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,904
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1251
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,467
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1252
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,031
Veer right!

1253
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,942
Okay, to the left.

1254
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,151
Hard right!

1255
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,620
Up and over.

1256
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,261
Okay, level off. Easy.

1257
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,382
Nice flying!

1258
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,310
Almost there!

1259
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,541
Baymax!

1260
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,141
Baymax!

1261
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,180
My thrusters are inoperable.

1262
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,381
Just grab hold.

1263
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,343
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.

1264
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,389
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

1265
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,907
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1266
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,780
- You are my patient.
- Baymax.

1267
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,345
Your health is my only concern.

1268
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,140
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1269
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,780
Are you satisfied with your care?

1270
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,820
No. There's gotta be another way.

1271
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,900
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.

1272
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,500
There is no time.

1273
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,384
Are you satisfied with your care?

1274
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,066
Please! No...

1275
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,264
I can't lose you, too.

1276
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,626
Hiro,

1277
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,701
I will always be with you.

1278
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,862
I'm satisfied with my care.

1279
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,900
Hiro!

1280
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,068
Yeah! They made it!

1281
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,986
Baymax?

1282
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,430
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1283
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,510
Abigail Callaghan.

1284
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,220
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1285
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,751
We're taking you to the hospital.

1286
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,981
Move it!

1287
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,501
Get in there.

1288
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,100
A massive cleanup continues today

1289
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,260
at the headquarters
of Krei Tech Industries.

1290
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,782
Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals,

1291
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:12,069
who prevented what could have been
a major catastrophe.

1292
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,780
The whole city
of San Fransokyo is asking,

1293
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,260
"Who are these heroes?
And where are they now?"

1294
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,791
- Hey.
- Hi.

1295
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,940
It's so exciting.

1296
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,426
Hey, sweetie!

1297
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,707
Okay.

1298
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,266
Last hug.

1299
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,661
Bye!

1300
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,343
- And just then I was like...
- Get out of here.

1301
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,381
Ow?

1302
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,671
I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

1303
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,466
Hello, Hiro.

1304
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,621
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1305
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,063
but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.

1306
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,140
The good thing is, my brother
wanted to help a lot of people,

1307
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,944
and that's what we're gonna do.

1308
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,660
Who are we?

1309
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,420
Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

1310
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,429
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1311
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,901
I've always felt a distance

1312
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,349
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

1313
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,710
and I just wish you could see how...

1314
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,101
Fred.

1315
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,941
Son.

1316
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,906
Dad?

1317
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,301
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1318
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,580
I go inside out,
then I go front and back.

1319
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,986
Dad!

1320
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,269
We have a lot to talk about.

1320
01:41:21,305 --> 01:42:21,771
