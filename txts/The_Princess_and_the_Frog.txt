And then we're gonna get ourselves married and live happily ever after, the end! Yeah, more or less. But remember, you must give Tiana all the money she requires for her restaurant. Because Tiana, she is my Evangeline. CHARLOTTE: Anything you want, sugar. Pucker up, buttercup. -TlANA: Wait! -Tiana? -Tiana? -Don't do this. l have to do this.
