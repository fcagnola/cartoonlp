The prince is trapped, too. Who cares about danger when there's love? Ugh, Anna. Bleugh! Kissing won't save the Forest. The lost fairies cry out. What sound does a giraffe make? Never mind. They wake the fairy queen... who breaks the spell and saves everyone! And they all get married! What are you playing? Enchanted Forest. The prince and the princess... Hmm. That's like no enchanted forest I've ever seen. You've seen an enchanted forest? Wait, what? I have. Once. And you've never told us this before? Well, I could tell you now, if you... Okay. Now. Tell us now. Are you sure about this? It's time they know. Let's make a big snowman later. If they can settle and listen. Far away... as north as we can go... stood a very old and very enchanted forest. But its magic wasn't that of goblin spells and lost fairies. It was protected by the most powerful spirits of all... those of air... of fire... of water... and earth. But it was also home to the mysterious Northuldra people. Were the Northuldra magical, like me? No, Elsa. They were not magical. They just took advantage of the Forest's gifts. Their ways were so different from ours... but still, they promised us friendship. In honor of that, your grandfather, King Runeard, built them a mighty dam... to strengthen their waters. It was a gift of peace. That's a big gift of peace. And I was so honored to get to go to the Forest to celebrate it. Stand tall, Agnarr. I wasn't at all prepared for what the day would bring. We let down our guard. We were charmed. Whoa. Whoa! It felt so... magical. But something went wrong. They were attacking us. Get behind me. It was a brutal battle. Your grandfather... Father! ...was lost. Aah! The fighting enraged the spirits. Look out! They turned their magic against us all. There was this voice... ...and someone saved me. I'm told the spirits then vanished. And a powerful mist covered the Forest. Locking everyone out. And that night, I came home King of Arendelle. Whoa, Papa, that was epic. Whoever saved you, I love them. I wish I knew who it was. What happened to the spirits? What's in the Forest now? I don't know. The mist still stands. No one can get in. And no one has since come out. So we're safe. Yes. But the Forest could wake again. And we must be prepared for whatever danger it may bring. And on that note, how about we say good night to your father? But I still have so many questions. Save them for another night, Anna. You know I don't have that kind of patience. Why did Northuldra attack us anyway? Who attacks people who give them gifts? Do you think the Forest will wake again? Only Ahtohallan knows. Octa-who-what? When I was little... my mother would sing a song about a special river called Ahtohallan... that was said to hold all the answers about the past. About what we are a part of. Wow. Will you sing it for us? Please? Okay. Cuddle close. Scooch in. Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Sleep, my darling, safe and sound For in this river, all is found In her waters Deep and true Lie the answers And a path for you Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned Yes, she will sing to those who hear And in her song, all magic flows But can you brave what you most fear? Can you face what the river knows? Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a mother Full of memory Come, my darling, homeward bound When all is lost Then all is found Your Majesty. Oh! They're ready. Excuse me. I'm coming. Do you hear that? What? Never mind. Enjoying your new permafrost, Olaf? I'm just living the dream, Anna. How I wish this could last forever. Mmm. And yet, change mocks us with her beauty. What's that? Forgive me. Maturity is making me poetic. Tell me, you're older and thus all-knowing... do you ever worry about the notion that... nothing is permanent? Uh... No. Really? Wow, I can't wait until I'm ancient like you... so I don't have to worry about important things. That's not what I mean. I don't worry because... well, I have you and Elsa and Kristoff and Sven... and the gates are open wide... and I'm not alone anymore. Yes, the wind blows a little bit colder And we're all getting older And the clouds are moving on With every autumn breeze Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser That's why I rely on certain certainties Yes, some things never change Like the feel of your hand in mine Some things stay the same Like how we get along just fine Like an old stone wall that'll never fall Some things are always true! Some things never change Like how I'm holding on tight to you The leaves are already falling Sven, it feels like the future is calling Are you telling me tonight You're gonna get down on one knee? Yeah, but I'm really bad at planning these things out Like candlelight and pulling of rings out Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me! Yeah, some things never change Like the love that I feel for her Some things stay the same Like how reindeers are easier But if I commit and I go for it I'll know what to say and do! Right? Some things never change Sven, the pressure is all on you The winds are restless Could that be why I'm hearing this call? Is something coming? I'm not sure I want things to change at all These days are precious Can't let them slip away I can't freeze this moment But I can still go out and seize this day! Oh! The wind blows a little bit colder And you all look a little bit older It's time to count our blessings Beneath an autumn sky We'll always live in a kingdom of plenty That stands for the good of the many! And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly! Our flag will always fly! Our flag will always fly Our flag will always fly Some things never change Turn around and the time has flown Some things stay the same Though the future remains unknown May our good luck last May our past be past Time's moving fast, it's true Some things never change And I'm holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you I'm holding on tight to you Uh, okay. Um, lion? Grizzly bear? Uh, monster? Brown bear? Angry face? Black bear? Uh... Hans? Unredeemable monster? Greatest mistake of your life? Wouldn't even kiss you? Villain! Oh! We all kind of got it. Okay, Olaf, you're up. Okay. So much easier now that I can read. Mm. Lightning round, boys against girls. Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready. Go. Unicorn. Ice cream! Castle! Oaken! Teapot! Mouse! Oh! Elsa! I don't think Olaf should get to rearrange. Doesn't matter. This is gonna be a cinch. Two sisters, one mind. Thank you. Okay. Here we go. You got this, Elsa. Hmm. Anytime. Just do it with your body. Uh, nothing? Air? Tree? People? Treeple? Oh, that's not a word. Oh, shovel boy? Teeth? Oh! Doing the dishes? Polar bear? Hey. Sorry. Uh... Ugh. You gotta give me something. Um... Oh! Uh, alarmed? Distracted? Um, worried? Panicking? Disturbed? Oh, come on, you definitely look disturbed. We won. Rematch? Oh, you know what? I think I'll turn in. Are you okay? Just... Just tired. Good night. Yeah, I'm tired, too. And Sven promised to read me a bedtime story. Didn't you, Sven? Did I? Oh, you do the best voices! Like when you pretend to be Kristoff, and you're like... "I just need to go talk to some rocks "about my childhood and stuff." Um, how about you guys start without me? Ugh. Did Elsa seem weird to you? She seemed like Elsa. Hmm. That last word really seemed to throw her. What was it? I don't know. Ahem. No. No. I don't know, but... Ah. "Ice"? Oh, come on! She couldn't act out ice? I better go check on her. Uh... Thanks, honey. Love you. Hmm? Love you, too. It's fine. Come in. Yep. Something's wrong. With you? No, with you. You're wearing Mother's scarf. You do that when something's wrong. Did we hurt your feelings? I'm so sorry if we did. You know, very few people are actually good at family games. That's just a fact. No, that's not it. Then, what is it? There's this... I just don't wanna mess things up. What things? You're doing great. Oh, Elsa, when are you going to see yourself the way I see you? What would I do without you? You'll always have me. I know what you need. Come on, come here. What? In Mama's words, "cuddle close, scooch in." Mm-hmm. Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory I know what you're doing. Sleep, my darling, safe and sound For in this river, all is found I can hear you But I won't Some look for trouble While others don't There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away, oh Oh You're not a voice You're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you Which I don't I'm spoken for, I fear Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls I'm sorry, Secret Siren But I'm blocking out your calls I've had my adventure I don't need something new I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake Are you here to distract me So I make a big mistake? Or are you someone out there Who's a little bit like me Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be? Every day's a little harder As I feel my power grow Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go Into the unknown? Into the unknown! Into the unknown! Whoa-oh-oh Are you out there? Do you know me? Can you feel me? Can you show me? Where are you going? Don't leave me alone How do I follow you Into the unknown? Air, fire, water, earth. The water! The air rages, no fire, no water. The earth is next. We have to get out. It'll be okay. Evacuate to the cliffs. Oh, no! I'm gonna blow! I've got you! Yes. Everyone's out and safe. Here. Take one of these. Huh? You okay there, Olaf? Oh, yeah. We're calling this... "controlling what you can when things feel out of control." Okay, I don't understand. You've been hearing a voice and you didn't think to tell me? I didn't want to worry you. We made a promise not to shut each other out. Just tell me what's going on. I woke the magical spirits at the Enchanted Forest. Okay, that's definitely not what I thought you were gonna say. Wait. The Enchanted Forest? The one Father warned us about? Yes. Why would you do that? Because of the voice. I know it sounds crazy... but I believe whoever is calling me is good. How can you say that? Look at our kingdom. I know. It's just that my magic can feel it. I can feel it. Okay. Oh, no. What now? The Trolls? Kristoff! We missed you! Oh! Pabbie. Well, never a dull moment with you two. I hope you're prepared for what you have done, Elsa. Angry magical spirits are not for the faint of heart. Why are they still angry? What does all of this have to do with Arendelle? Let me see what I can see. The past is not what it seems. A wrong demands to be righted. Arendelle is not safe. The truth must be found. Without it... I see no future. No future? When one can see no future... all one can do is the next right thing. The next right thing is for me to go to the Enchanted Forest... and find that voice. Kristoff, can I borrow your wagon and Sven? Hmm? I'm not very comfortable with the idea of that. You are not going alone. Anna, no. I have my powers to protect me. You don't. Excuse me, I climbed the North Mountain... survived a frozen heart, and saved you from my ex-boyfriend... and I did it all without powers, so, you know, I'm coming. Me, too. I'll drive. I'll bring the snacks! I will look after your people. Please make sure they stay out of the kingdom until we return. Of course. Let's let them know. Anna, I am worried for her. We have always feared Elsa's powers were too much for this world. Now, we must pray they are enough. I won't let anything happen to her. Hyah! Who's into trivia? I am. Okay. Did you know that water has memory? True fact. It's disputed by many, but it's true. Did you know men are six times more likely to be struck by lightning? Did you know gorillas burp when they're happy? Did you know we blink four million times a day? Did you know wombats poop squares? Did you know sleeping quietly on long journeys prevents insanity? Yeah, that's not true. It is. It's true. Definitely true. No, it's the truth. Well, that was unanimous. But I will look it up when we get home. They're both asleep. So, what do you wanna do? Sven, keep us steady, will ya? Hmm... Anna. Ahem. Anna? Mm-hmm? Remember our first trip like this... when I said you'd have to be crazy to want to marry a man you just met? Wait, what? Crazy? You didn't say I was crazy. You think I'm crazy? No. I did. You were... Huh? ...not crazy. Clearly. Just naive. Not naive. Just, uh, new to love. Like I was. And when you're new, you're bound to get it wrong. So you're saying I'm wrong for you. What? No, no. I'm not saying you're wrong, or crazy. Kristoff, stop. Please. Good idea. I hear it. I hear the voice. You do? Olaf, wake up. Whoa. Wow. Whoa! What the... Whoa. Promise me, we do this together, okay? I promise. It's okay. Did you know that an enchanted forest is a place of transformation? I have no idea what that means... but I can't wait to see what it's gonna do to each one of us. Hey! What is this? No pushing. Stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's too fast. What was that? No. No, no, no. And we're locked in. Probably should have seen that one coming. This forest is beautiful. Ooh. The dam. It still stands. It was in Grand Pabbie's visions. But why? I don't know, but it's still in good shape. Thank goodness. What do you mean? Well, if that dam broke... it would send a tidal wave so big it would wash away everything on this fjord. Everything? But Arendelle's on this fjord. Nothing's gonna happen to Arendelle, Anna. It's gonna be fine. Come here. You know, under different circumstances, this would be a, uh, pretty romantic place. Don't you think? Different circumstances? You mean, like with someone else? What? No! No. I'm saying... Just in case we don't make it out of here... Wait, what? You don't think we're gonna make it out of here? No. No! I mean, no, we will make it out of here. Well, technically the odds are kind of complicated, but my point is... In case we die... You think we're gonna die? No! No, no, no. Where's Elsa? We will die at some point. I swore that I wouldn't leave her side. Not in any recent time will we die. Elsa! But way far in the future, we will die. Don't patronize me. Elsa! There you are. You okay? I'm fine. Okay, good. Where's Olaf? Um... Anna? Elsa? Sven? Samantha? I don't even know a Samantha. Whoa! Mm. That's normal. What was that? Samantha? This will all make sense when I am older Someday I will see that this makes sense One day when I'm old and wise I'll think back and realize That these were all completely normal events! I'll have all the answers when I'm older Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood I know in a couple years These will seem like childish fears And so I know this isn't bad, it's good Excuse me Growing up means adapting Puzzling out your world and your place When I'm more mature I'll feel totally secure Being watched by something with a creepy, creepy face See, that will all make sense when I am older So there's no need to be terrified or tense I'll just dream about a time When I'm in my aged prime 'Cause when you're older Absolutely everything makes sense! This is fine. Whoa! Olaf! Hey, guys. Meet the Wind Spirit. Coming through! Ooh, I think I'm gonna be sick. I'd hold your hair back, but I can't find my arms. Hey! Stop! Elsa! Let her go! Anna, be careful! That's my sister! Prince Agnarr! For Arendelle. Look out! Father! Are you okay? I'm fine. What are these? Oh, they look like moments in time. What's that thing you say, Olaf? The thing... Oh! My theory about advancing technologies as both our savior and our doom? No, not that one. The one about... The one about cucumbers? No. The thing about water. Oh! Yeah. Water has memory. The water that makes up you and me has passed through at least four humans... and/or animals before us. Hmm. And remembers everything. The wind's back. Delicious. I think I'll name you Gale. Get out of there. Whoa! Oh. Hi. Aren't you curious? You in a better mood now? Father. That's Father. This girl. She's saving him. She's Northuldra. What is that? Olaf, get behind me. What are you gonna do with that? I have no idea. Lower your weapon. And you lower yours. Arendellian soldiers? Threatening my people, Lieutenant? Invading my dance space, Yelena? Why does that soldier look so familiar? No, no, no. Lieutenant! Get the sword! That was magic. Did you see that? Of course I saw it. You chose a nice, cold greeting. They've been trapped in here this whole time? Yeah. What do we do now? I got this. Hi, I'm Olaf. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just find clothes restricting. Bet you're wondering who we are and why we're here. It's really quite simple. It began with two sisters. One born with magical powers. One born powerless. Their love of snowmen, infinite. Anna, no! Too high! Blast! Mama! Papa! Help! Slam! Doors shutting everywhere. Sisters torn apart. Well, at least they have their parents. Their parents are dead. Oh. Oh, hi. I'm Anna. I'll marry a man I just met. Elsa's gonna blow! Snow! Snow! Aah, run! Magic pulses through my snowflakes. I live. Ice palace for one. Ice palace for one. Get out, Anna. Pew! Pew! My heart. Oh, my goodness. Only an act of true love can save you. Here's a true love's kiss. You're not worth it. Guess what? I'm the bad guy. What? And Anna freezes to death forever. Oh, Anna. Then she unfreezes! Oh, and then Elsa woke up the magical spirits... and we were forced out of our kingdom. Now our only hope is to find the truth about the past... but we don't have a clue how to do that... except Elsa's hearing voices, so we got that going for us. Any questions? I think they got it. Are you really Queen of Arendelle? I am. Why would nature reward a person of Arendelle with magic? Perhaps to make up for the actions of your people. My people are innocent. We would have never attacked first. May the truth be found. Mm... Hi. I'm sorry. Uh, what's happening? Hmm. That's it. Lieutenant Mattias! Library, second portrait on the left. You were our father's official guard. Agnarr. What did happen to your parents? Our parents' ship went down in the Southern Sea... six years ago. I see him. I see him in your faces. Really? Soldiers. We may be getting on in years, but we're still strong. And proud to serve Arendelle. Wait. Please. Someone has called me here. If I can just find them... I believe they have the answers that may help us free this forest. Trust me, I just want to help. We only trust nature. When nature speaks... ...we listen. This will all make sense when I'm older. Fire Spirit! Get back, everyone! Head for the river! No! No! No! The reindeer! That's a dead end! Come on, Sven! We'll get them. Elsa! Get out of there! No, no, no. Elsa! Come on, buddy, we can do this. Hyah! Anna! Oh! Get her out of here. No! Elsa! They're all looking at us, aren't they? Got any advice? Nothing? Hmm. Should I know what that means? You hear it, too. Somebody's calling us. Who is it? What do we do? Okay, keep going north. Elsa! Oh, thank goodness! Anna. Are you okay? What were you doing? You could've been killed. You can't just follow me into fire. You don't want me to follow you into fire, then don't run into fire. You're not being careful, Elsa. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I've been better. Hmm. I know what you need. Where did you get that scarf? That's a Northuldra scarf. What? This is from one of our oldest families. It was our mother's. Elsa. I see it. It's Mother. Mother saved Father's life that day. Our mother was Northuldra. We are called Northuldra. We are the people of the sun. I promise you I will free this forest... and restore Arendelle. That's a pretty big promise, Elsa. Free the Forest? Wow. I'm sorry. It's just, uh, some of us were born in here, we've never even seen a clear sky. I get it. The name's Ryder. Kristoff. I heard the voice again. We need to go north. But the Earth Giants now roam the north at night. You can leave in the morning. I'm Honeymaren. Honeymaren, we'll do all we can. Hey, let me ask you. How do you guys cope... with the ever-increasing complexity of thought that comes with maturity? Brilliant! Oh! It's so refreshing to talk to the youth of today. Our future's in bright hands. Oh, no, no. Don't chew that. You don't know what I've stepped in. I can't seem to get her attention. Or even say the right thing. Well, you're in luck. I know nothing about women. But I do know that we have the most amazing way of proposing. If we start now, we'll be ready by dawn. Really? Best part, it involves a lot of reindeer. Whoa. Hey, back at home... Halima still over at Hudson's Hearth? She is. Really? She married? Mm-mm. Oh, wow. Why didn't that make me feel better? What else do you miss? My father. He passed long before all this. He was a great man. Built us a good life in Arendelle. But taught me to never take the good for granted. He'd say, "Be prepared. "Just when you think you've found your way, "life will throw you onto a new path." What do you do when it does? Don't give up. Take it one step at a time and... Just do the next right thing? Yeah. You got it. I wanna show you something. May I? You know air, fire, water, and earth. Yes. But, look, there's a fifth spirit... said to be a bridge between us and the magic of nature. A fifth spirit? Some say they heard it call out the day the Forest fell. My father heard it. Do you think that is who's calling me? Maybe. Alas, only Ahtohallan knows. Ahtohallan. Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned Why do lullabies always have to have some terrible warning in them? I wonder that all the time. Earth Giants. What are they doing down here? Shh! Hide. They're coming! This is why we don't play with fire. Oh, I can't stay mad at you. Why are you so cute? Please tell me you were not about to follow them. What if I can settle them like I did the wind and fire? Or what if they can crush you before you even get the chance? Remember, the goal is to find the voice... find the truth, and get us home. Hey, guys. That was close. I know. The giants sensed me. They may come back here. I don't want to put anyone at risk again. And you're right, Anna. We've got to find the voice. We're going now. Okay. We're going. Let me just... Wait. Where are Kristoff and Sven? Oh, yeah. I think they took off with that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer. They left? Mm-hmm. Just left without saying anything? Who knows the ways of men? Am I supposed to feel this ridiculous? Oh, yeah. Definitely. Everyone ready? Ready! Uh, I could use a rehearsal. I love love. Wait. You talk for them, too? I do. It's like you can actually hear what they're thinking. Yeah. And then you just say it. And then you just say it. Okay. Here she comes. Princess Anna of Arendelle... my feisty, fearless, ginger-sweet love. Will you marry me? Um... No. The princess left with the queen. What? Wait, what? What? I wouldn't try to follow. They're long gone. Long gone? So, yeah. Um, we're heading west to the Lichen Meadows. You can come with us if you want. Hey. Um... I'm really sorry that... No, it's fine. Yeah. Yep. Okay, I better go pack. You coming with? I'll just... Yeah, I'll meet you there. Okay, uh, you know where you're going, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I know the woods. Reindeers are better than people Sven, why is love so hard? You feel what you feel And those feelings are real Come on, Kristoff Let down your guard Again, you're gone Off on a diff'rent path than mine I'm left behind Wondering if I should follow You had to go And, of course, it's always fine I prob'ly could catch up with you tomorrow But is this what it feels like to be growing apart? When did I become the one Who's always chasing your heart? Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods North is South Right is left When you're gone I'm the one who sees you home But now I'm lost in the woods And I don't know what path you are on I'm lost in the woods Up till now The next step was a question of how I never thought it was a question of whether Who am I If I'm not your guy? Where am I if we're not together? Forever Now I know you're my true North 'Cause I am lost in the woods Up is down Day is night When you're not there Oh, you're my only landmark So I'm lost in the woods Wondering if you still care But I'll wait For a sign For a sign That I'm your path 'Cause you are mine You are mine Until then I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods In the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost I'm lost in the woods Hey, Olaf, um, maybe just one of you should do it. I agree. She's a little pitchy. Hey, Gale's back. What? How can it be? What is it? Mother and Father's ship. But this isn't the Southern Sea. No, it isn't. Why is their ship here? How is it here? It must have been washed in from the Dark Sea. What were they doing in the Dark Sea? I don't know. How did the ship get through the mist? I thought nobody could but us. Unless nobody was on it. There's gotta be something here. Wait. Wait. Look around. Every Arendellian ship has a compartment. Waterproof. That's very clever. Although, it does make me wonder why they don't just make the whole ship waterproof. Here. What language is this? I don't know. But look, this is Mother's handwriting. "The end of the ice age. "The river found, but lost. "Magic's source. Elsa's source?" It's a map. They traveled north and planned to cross the Dark Sea to... Ahtohallan. It's real? Octa-who-what? Ahtohallan. It's a magical river said to hold all the answers about the past. Reinforcing my "water has memory" theory. Mm. Water has memory. Elsa? I wanna know what happened to them. Ahtohallan has to be the source of her magic. We keep going for Elsa. The waves are too high! Iduna! Agnarr! Elsa! Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? This is my fault. They were looking for answers about me. You are not responsible for their choices, Elsa. No. Just their deaths. Stop. No. Yelena asked, why would the spirits reward Arendelle with a magical queen? Because our mother saved our father. She saved her enemy. Her good deed was rewarded with you. You are a gift. For what? If anyone can resolve the past... if anyone can save Arendelle and free this forest, it's you. I believe in you, Elsa. More than anyone or anything. Honeymaren said there was a fifth spirit. A bridge between the magic of nature and us. A fifth spirit? That's who's been calling me from Ahtohallan. The answers about the past are all there. So we go to Ahtohallan. Not "we." Me. What? The Dark Sea is too dangerous for us both. No. No! We do this together. Remember the song? "Go too far and you'll be drowned." Who will stop you from going too far? You said you believed in me, that this is what I was born to do. And I don't wanna stop you from that. I... I don't wanna stop you from being whatever you need to be. I just don't want you dying... trying to be everything for everyone else, too. Don't do this alone. Let me help you, please. I can't lose you, Elsa. I can't lose you either, Anna. Come on. Mmm. Wait, what? What are you doing? Elsa! No! No! Olaf, help me stop. Give me a hand. Hang on! Whoa! Wait. Wait! No! No! No! Oh, come on! Anna, this might sound crazy... but I'm sensing some rising anger. Well, I am angry, Olaf! She promised me we'd do this together! Yeah. Uh-huh. But what I mean is, I'm sensing rising anger in me. Wait, you're angry? Um, I... I think so. Elsa pushed me away, too, and didn't even say goodbye. And you have every right to be very, very mad at her. And you said some things never change. But since then, everything's done nothing but change. I know. But look, I'm still here holding your hand. Yeah, that's a good point, Anna. I feel better. You're such a good listener. Don't shush me. That's rude. No! No! Oh. The Giants. They're huge. Hang on, Olaf. Huh? Try not to scream. Found it. Thank you. Where are we? In a pit with no way out. But with a spooky, pitch-black way in. Come on, it'll be fun. Assuming we don't get stuck here forever, no one ever finds us... and you starve and I give up. But, bright side, Elsa's gotta be doing a whole lot better than we are. Okay. Oh. Whoa! No! Whoa! No! Of course. Glaciers are rivers of ice. Ahtohallan is frozen. I hear you. And I'm coming. Every inch of me is trembling But not from the cold Something is familiar Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold I can sense you there Like a friend I've always known I'm arriving And it feels like I am home I have always been a fortress Cold secrets deep inside You have secrets, too But you don't have to hide Show yourself I'm dying to meet you Show yourself It's your turn Are you the one I've been looking for all of my life? Show yourself I'm ready to learn I've never felt so certain All my life I've been torn But I'm here for a reason Could it be the reason I was born? I have always been so different Normal rules did not apply Is this the day? Are you the way I finally find out why? Show yourself! I'm no longer trembling Here I am I've come so far You are the answer I've waited for All of my life Oh, show yourself! Let me see who you are Come to me now Open your door Don't make me wait One moment more Oh, come to me now Open your door Don't make me wait One moment more Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Mother. Come, my darling, homeward bound I am found! Show yourself Step into your power Grow yourself Into something new You are the one you've been waiting for All of my life IDUNA: All of your life Oh, show yourself! Hi, I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. I love you, Olaf! Come on, you can do it. Here I stand Oh. In the light of day Oh! Like a chicken with the face of a monkey! I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm great actually. Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. I love you. I need to tell you about my past. And where I'm from. I'm listening. Iduna! What are you reading, Your Majesty? Oh, some new Danish author. King Runeard, I'm sorry. I don't understand. Grandfather? We bring Arendelle's full guard. But they have given us no reason not to trust them. The Northuldra follow magic. Which means we can never trust them. Grandfather? Magic makes people feel too powerful. Too entitled. It makes them think they can defy the will of a king. That is not what magic does. That's just your fear. Fear is what can't be trusted. You see, the dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me. Dive down deep into her sound But not too far, or you'll be drowned They will come in celebration. And then, we will know their size and strength. As you have welcomed us, we welcome you... our neighbors, our friends. King Runeard, the dam isn't strengthening our waters. It's hurting the Forest. It's cutting off the North... Let... Let's not discuss this here. Let's meet on the fjord. Have tea. Find a solution. No! Anna! Hmm. Which lucky tunnel do we choose? You see, the dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me. King Runeard, the dam, it's hurting the Forest. Elsa's found it. What is it? The truth about the past. That's my grandfather... attacking the Northuldra leader... who wields no weapon. The dam wasn't a gift of peace. It was a trick. But that goes against everything Arendelle stands for. It does, doesn't it? I know how to free the Forest. I know what we have to do to set things right. Why do you say that so sadly? We have to break the dam. But Arendelle will be flooded. That's why everyone was forced out. To protect them from what has to be done. Oh. Oh! Are you okay? I could really use a bright side, Olaf. Bright side? Um... Turtles can breathe through their butts. Huh? And I see a way out. I knew I could count on you. Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably on her way back right now. We can meet her and... Olaf? What's this? Are you okay? I'm flurrying? Wait. No. That's... That's not it. I'm flurrying away. The magic in me is fading. What? I don't think Elsa's okay. I think... she may have gone too far. No. No. Anna? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to do this next part on your own. Okay? Wait. Come here. I've got you. Oh. That's good. Hey, Anna? I just thought of one thing that's permanent. What's that? Love. Warm hugs? I like warm hugs. I love you. Olaf? Elsa? What do I do now? I've seen dark before But not like this This is cold This is empty This is numb The life I knew is over The lights are out Hello, darkness I'm ready to succumb I follow you around I always have But you've gone to a place I cannot find This grief has a gravity It pulls me down But a tiny voice Whispers in my mind You are lost Hope is gone But you must go on And do the next right thing Can there be a day beyond this night? I don't know anymore what is true I can't find my direction I'm all alone The only star that guided me was you How to rise from the floor When it's not you I'm rising for? Just do the next right thing Take a step Step again It is all that I can To do the next right thing I won't look too far ahead It's too much for me to take But break it down to this next breath This next step This next choice is one that I can make! So I'll walk through this night Stumbling blindly toward the light And do the next right thing And with the dawn What comes then? When it's clear that everything Will never be the same again? Then I'll make the choice To hear that voice And do The next right thing Wake up! Wake up! That's it. Come and get me! Come on! Over here! That's right. Keep coming. Keep coming! That'll work. This way, guys! What? No, no, no, no. She's leading them to the dam. Kristoff! I'm here. What do you need? To get to the dam. You got it. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Help me up! We'll meet you around! Lieutenant Mattias. Your Highness, what are you doing? The dam must fall. It's the only way to break the mist and free the Forest. But we've sworn to protect Arendelle at all costs. Arendelle has no future until we make this right. King Runeard betrayed everyone. How do you know that? My sister gave her life for the truth. Please. Before we lose anyone else. Look out! Destroy the dam! Come on! Throw your boulders. That's it. I've got her! Anna! Hang on! I'm sorry I left you behind. I was just so desperate to protect her. I know. I know. It's okay. My love is not fragile. Wow. Look at the sky. I just didn't realize there was so much of it. 34 years... Five months... And 23 days. Is it really you? Anna. I thought I'd lost you. Lost me? You saved me. Again. I did? And, Anna, Arendelle did not fall. It didn't? The spirits all agreed. Arendelle deserves to stand with you. Me? You did what was right. For everyone. Did you find the fifth spirit? You are the fifth spirit. You're the bridge. Well, actually, a bridge has two sides. And Mother had two daughters. We did this together. And we'll continue to do this together. Together. Elsa! You're okay! You look different. Did you cut your hair or something? Or something. Oh. Anna, I need to ask you a question. Okay. Do you want to build a snowman? What? Thank goodness water has memory. Anna. Elsa! Kristoff! And Sven! You all came back. Oh, I love happy endings. I mean, I presume we're done. Or is this "putting us in mortal danger" situation gonna be a regular thing? No. We're done. Actually, there is one more thing. Anna, you are the most extraordinary person I've ever known. I love you with all I am. Will you marry me? Oh. Yes! Ah. Aw. Arendelle's okay. What? Ahtohallan is beautiful. Oh! Hello. You know, you belong up here. I took an oath to always do what's best for Arendelle. Luckily, I know just what that is. While I still don't know what "transformation" means... I feel like this Forest has really changed us all. Presenting Her Majesty, Queen Anna of Arendelle! Oh! Hello. Hi. Sven, don't you look nice. Oh, my goodness! Olaf! Charmed, I'm sure. Charming. Your Majesty. Kristoff. Aw, did you boys get all dressed up for me? It was Sven's idea. One hour. You get this for one hour. That's okay. I prefer you in leather anyway. I'm shocked you can last an hour. That was brutal. The things we do for love. What is this crazy magic called again? A photograph. Photograph. Huh. We look good. Halima. General Mattias. Uh, Your Majesty. I'll be right back. You can look at our photograph while I'm gone. I'm just kidding. How am I doing? Fantastic. Our lands and people, now connected by love. Hi, Gale. You like it? Oh, do you mind? I've got a message for my sister. Thank you. "Charades Friday night. Don't be late. "And don't worry, Arendelle's doing just fine. "Keep looking after the Forest. "I love you." I love you, too, sis. Hey, Gale? We're going for a ride, wanna come? You ready? Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh I can hear you but I won't Some look for trouble while others don't There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away Oh oh oh Whoa oh You're not a voice You're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you which I don't I'm spoken for I fear Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls I'm sorry, secret siren But I'm blocking out your calls I've had my adventure I don't need something new I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you... Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake? Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me? Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be? Every day's a little harder As I feel your power grow Don't you know there's a part of me That longs to go... Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh Whoa oh oh Are you out there? Do you know me? Can you feel me? Can you show me? Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Where are you going? Don't leave me alone How do I follow you Into the unknown Whoo! Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Sleep, my darling Safe and sound For in this river, all is found All is found When all is lost then all is found In her waters Deep and true Lie the answers and a path for you Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned She will sing to those who hear And in her song all magic flows But can you brave what you most fear? Can you face what the river knows? Until the river's finally crossed You'll never feel the solid ground You have to get a little lost On your way To being found Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a mother Full of memory Come, my darling, homeward bound Where all is lost Then all is found All is found All is found Again you're gone Off on a diff'rent path than mine I'm left behind Wondering if I should follow You had to go And, of course, it's always fine I prob'ly could catch up with you tomorrow But is this what it feels like To be growing apart? When did I become the one Who's always chasing your heart? Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods North is South Right is left When you're gone I'm the one who sees you home But now I'm lost in the woods And I don't know what path you are on I'm lost in the woods Up till now The next step was a question of how I never thought it was a question of whether Who am I If I'm not your guy? Where am I if we're not together? Forever Now I know you're my true North 'Cause I am lost in the woods Up is down Day is night When you're not there Oh, you're my only landmark So I'm lost in the woods Wondering if you still care But I'll wait For a sign For a sign That I'm your path 'Cause you are mine You are mine Until then I'm lost in the woods‎ Lost in the woods In the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost I'm lost in the woods Show yourself right now! Elsa, be who you are. Oh, I will, Mama, I will. Elsa's dead. Olaf's dead. Anna cries. And then a bunch of important things happen that I forgot. But all that matters is, I was right. And water has memory, and thus... I live! And so do you. Whoa! We live! We live! Oh! Good story. Subtitles by <>explosiveskull Sync by <>GoldenBeard
