(INSTRUMENTAL CELTIC MUSIC PLAYING) NARRATOR: On the clearest of nights, when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful, (SHIP CREAKING) the great merchant ships, with their cargoes of Arcturian solar crystals, felt safe and secure. Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates. And the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious Captain Nathaniel Flint. Fire! (ALL GASPING) Aah! Like a Candarian zaftwing overtaking its prey... SARAH: James Pleiades Hawkins. I thought you were asleep an hour ago. Mom, I was just getting to the best part. Please? Oh! Can those eyes get any bigger? Scootch over. NARRATOR: ...like a Candarian zaftwing overtaking its prey, Flint and his band of renegades swooped in out of nowhere. (LAUGHING EVILLY) And then, gathering up their spoils, vanished without a trace. Ooh! Ooh! NARRATOR: Flint's secret trove was never found, but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the farthest reaches of the galaxy, stowed with riches beyond imagination, the loot of a thousand worlds, Treasure Planet. Treasure Planet. Okay. Blow your nose. (HONKING) How do you think Captain Flint did it, Mom? How'd he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace? I have no idea. Come here, you... I'm gonna get... (BLOWING RASPBERRY) (GIGGLING) Okay, now it's time for this little spacer to go to sleep. You think somebody'll ever find Treasure Planet? Sweetheart, I think it's more like a legend. I know it's real. You win. It's real. Nighty-night, Mom. Nighty-night, sweetheart. I love you. Love you, too. (RUSTLING) NARRATOR: There are nights when the winds of the Etherium, so inviting in their promise of flight and freedom, made one's spirit soar! Yahoo! (ALARM RINGING) Whoo! Come on! Whoo! (LAUGHS) Whoo-hoo! (SIRENS BLARING) Oh, great. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Mrs. Hawkins! I know, refill on the purpjuice. Coming right up, Mrs. Dunwiddie. There we go. That's four powdered spheroids, two lunar eclipses, and it's a big bowl of Zorellian jelly worms for the big boy! Awesome! Enjoy. Sorry, Delbert. It's been a madhouse here all morning. No problem, Sarah. Ah! My Alponian chowder with the extra solara seed. Mmm! Yum! (SNIFFING) Hello. What brings you here, curious little one? Go away. Are your parents around? What's the matter? Cat got your... Aah! (GULPING) Oh, they're so adorable at that age. Oh, yes, deplorable... Uh... Adorable! Hmm. Speaking of which, how's Jim doing? Much better. I know he had some rough spots earlier this year, but I really think that he's starting to turn a corner. Mrs. Hawkins? Jim! (DISHES CLATTER) Ooh... Wrong turn. Okay. Thanks for the lift, guys. Not so fast. We apprehended your son operating a solar vehicle in a restricted area. Moving violation 9-0-4, section 15, paragraph, um... Six? Thank you. Don't mention it. Jim! As you are aware, ma'am, this constitutes a violation of his probation. Yes, yes. No, I understand. Um... But could we just... DOPPLER: Um, ahem, pardon me. Officers, if I might, uh, interject here. I am the noted astrophysicist Dr. Delbert Doppler. Perhaps you've heard of me. No? I have a clipping. Are you the boy's father? Good heavens, no! Ewww! He's just an old friend of the family. Back off, sir! Thank you, Delbert. I will take it from here. Well, Sarah, if you insist. Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again. Due to repeated violations of statute 15-C, we have impounded his vehicle. Any more slip-ups will result in a one-way ticket to Juvenile Hall. Kiddie hoosegow. The slammo. Thank you, Officers. It won't happen again. We see his type all the time, ma'am. Wrong choices. Dead-enders. Losers. You take care now. Let's motor. (CONVERSATIONS RESUME) Jim, I have had it. Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? Is that it? Jim? Jim, look at me. It's been hard enough keeping this place afloat by myself without you going... Mom, it's no big deal. There was nobody around. Those cops just won't get off my... Forget it. Mrs. Hawkins! My juice! Yes, I'll be right there, Mrs. Dunwiddie. Jim, I just don't want to see you throw away your entire future. Yeah, what future? (THUNDER RUMBLING) DOPPLER: I really don't know how you manage it, Sarah. Trying to run a business while raising a felon like... Felon... Fellow... Fellow like Jim. Managing it? I'm at the end of my rope. Ever since his father left, well, Jim's just never recovered. And you know how smart he is. He built his first solar surfer when he was eight! And yet, he's failing at school, he is constantly in trouble, and when I talk to him, he's like a stranger to me. I don't know, Delbert. I've tried everything. (ENGINES SPUTTERING) Hey, Mister? Mister, you're okay in there, right? -(GROWLING) Aah! (COUGHING) He's a-comin'. Can you hear him? Those gears and gyros clickin' and whirrin' like the devil himself! Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn't ya? He's after me chest, that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats. (STRAINING) But they'll have to pry it from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore I... Argh! (COUGHING) Oh, my... Come on, give me your arm. That's it. Good lad. Mom's gonna love this. Thanks for listening, Delbert. (SIGHS) It helps. It's going to be okay. You'll see. I keep dreaming one day I'll open that door, and there he'll be, just the way he was. A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet and begging me to let him keep it. (THUNDER) (GASPS) James Pleiades Hawkins! Mom, he's hurt bad! Me chest, lad. (GASPING) He'll be comin' soon. Can't let them find this. Who's coming? (WHISPERING) The cyborg! Beware the cyborg! (GASPS) Ohh! (RUMBLING) (SARAH GASPS) Quick! We gotta go! I believe I'm with Jim on this one! (PIRATES SHOUTING) Delilah! Hallelujah! (YELPING EXCITEDLY) Stay! Don't move! PIRATE: Where is it? Find it! DOPPLER: Don't worry, Sarah I'm an expert in the laws of physical science. On the count of three. One... Three! Aah! Aah! Go, Delilah! Go! Go! That's it! That's it! Go! Hyah! Hyah! DOPPLER: I just spoke with the constabulary. Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace. I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn has burned to the ground. Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble over that odd little sphere. Those markings baffle me. Unlike anything I've ever encountered. Even with my vast experience -and superior intellect, -(BEEPING AND WHIRRING) it would take me years to unlock its... Hey! (GASPS) Why, it's a map! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! This is us, the planet Montressor. (GASPS) That's the Magellanic Cloud! Whoo! The Coral Galaxy! That's the Cygnus Cross, and that's the Kerian Abyss. Wait. What's this? What's this? Why, it... It's... Treasure Planet. No! That's Treasure Planet! DOPPLER: Flint's trove? The loot of a thousand worlds? You know what this means? It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away. Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place atop the pantheon of explorers! He'd be able to experience... -(CLICK) Whoo! What just happened? Mom, this is it. This is the answer to all our problems. Jim, there is absolutely no way... Don't you remember, all those stories? That's all they were. Stories! With that treasure, we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over! Well, this is... lt's just... Oh, my. Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is? It's totally preposterous, traversing the entire galaxy alone. Now, at last, we hear some sense! That's why I'm going with you. Delbert! I'll use my savings to finance the expedition. I'll commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew. You're not serious. All my life I've been waiting for an opportunity like this, and here it is screaming, "Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!" Okay. Okay! You're both grounded! (SIGHS) JIM: Mom, look, I know that I keep messing everything up, and I know that I let you down. But this is my chance to make it up to you. I'm gonna set things right. Sarah? If I may? You said yourself, you've tried everything. There are much worse remedies than a few character-building months in space. Are you saying this because it's the right thing, or because you really want to go? I really, really, really, really want to go, and it's the right thing. (SIGHS) Jim, I don't want to lose you. Mom, you won't. I'll make you proud. DOPPLER; Well, uh, ahem... There we are then. We'll begin preparations at once. Jim, my boy, soon we'll be off to the spaceport. (SQUAWKING) (CREATURES SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGES) DOPPLER: Jim! Oh, Jim! Wait for me! (CLANKING) Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity for the two of us to get to know one another. You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um, well, contempt, but in our case... Look, let's just find the ship. Okay? Second berth on your right! You can't miss it. Hey, thanks. It's the suit, isn't it? I should never have listened to that pushy two-headed saleswoman. This one said it fit, that one said it was my color. I didn't know what to do. I get so flustered. Ooh! Oh, Jim! This is our ship! The R.L.S. Legacy! Whoa! OFFICER: Stow those casks forward! Heave together now! How cool is this? (SQUISHING NOISE) Sorry about that. I didn't mean... -(ANGRY FARTING NOISES) Allow me to handle this. (BLOWING RASPBERRIES) (SQUEAKING) (HAPPY FART NOISES) I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim. Took two years of it in high school. (BLOWS) Flatula? Cool. Good morning, Captain. Everything shipshape? Shipshape it is, sir, but I'm not the captain. The captain's aloft. (MEOW$) Mr. Arrow, I've checked this miserable ship from stem to stern and, as usual, it's spot on. Can you get nothing wrong? You flatter me, Captain. Ah. Dr. Doppler, I presume? Uh, um... Yes. I... Hello! Can you hear me? Yes, I can! Stop that banging! If I may, Doctor, this works so much better -when it's right-way up and plugged in. Ooh! Lovely. There you go. If you don't mind, I can manage my own plugging! I'm Captain Amelia, late of a few run-ins with the Protean Armada. Nasty business, but I won't bore you with my scars. You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow. Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true. Please, Captain. Shut up, Arrow. You know I don't mean a word of it. Ahem. Excuse me. I hate to interrupt this lovely banter, but may I introduce to you Jim Hawkins? Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure... Doctor, please! (GROWLS) I'd like a word with you in my stateroom. Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map in front of this particular crew demonstrates a level of ineptitude that borders on the imbecilic, and I mean that in a very caring way. "Imbecilic," did you say? Foolishness, I've... May I see the map, please? Here. Hmm. Fascinating. Mr. Hawkins, in the future, you will address me as "Captain" or "ma'am." Is that clear? Ugh... Mr. Hawkins? Yes, ma'am. That'll do. Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key when not in use. And, Doctor, again, with the greatest possible respect, zip your howling screamer. Captain, I assure you I... Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible. I don't much care for this crew you hired. They're... How did I describe them, Arrow? I said something rather good this morning before coffee. "A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots," ma'am. There you go. Poetry. Now, see here... Doctor, I'd love to chat, tea, cake, the whole shebang, but I have a ship to launch, and you've got your outfit to buff up. Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes down to the galley straightaway. Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver. What? The cook? That woman! That feline! Who does she think is working for whom? It's my map, and she's got me bussin' tables? I'll not tolerate a cross word about our captain! There's no finer officer in this or any galaxy. (WHISTLING) ARROW; Mr. Silver? Why, Mr. Arrow, sir. Bringin' in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley. Had I known, I'd have tucked in me shirt. (CHUCKUNG) A cyborg! May I introduce Dr. Doppler, the financier of our voyage. Love the outfit, Doc. Well, thank you. Um, love the eye. Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins. Jimbo! Now, don't be too put off by this hunk of hardware. (HUMMING) Whoa! These gears have been tough getting used to, but they do come in mighty handy from time to time. Mmm! Here, now, have a taste of me famous bonzabeast stew. (SNIFFING) Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust. SILVER: Old family recipe. Aah! In fact, that was part of the old family! (LAUGHS) I'm just kiddin', Doc! Yeah, well... I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder. Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig. (GIGGLING) SILVER: Morph! You jiggle-headed blob of mischief! So that's where you was hiding! (CHATTERING) (BELCH) What is that thing? "What is that thing?" SILVER: He's a morph. I rescued the little shape-shifter on Proteus 1. (COOING) Aw, he took a shine to me. We been together ever since. Right? Yeah. Nice boy. We're about to get underway. Would you like to observe the launch, Doctor? Would I? Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets? I'll follow you. Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver. (COUGHING) Beggin' your pardon, sir, but... Captain's orders! See to it the new cabin boy's kept busy. But, no, but... No, you can't... (BOTH SIGH) So, Captain's put you with me, eh? Whatever. Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain? Yeah. You know, these purps, they're kind of like the ones back home on Montressor. You ever been there? I can't say as I have, Jimbo. Come to think of it, just before I left, I met this old guy who was, um... He was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his. Is that so? Yeah. What was that old salamander's name? Oh, yeah. Bones. Billy Bones? Bones? Bones? T'ain't ringin' any bells. Must have been a different cyborg. There's a slew of cyborgs roamin' this port. -(WHISTLE ON DECK) ARROW: Prepare to cast off! Off with you, lad, and watch the launch. There'll be plenty work a-waitin' for you afterwards. -(HUMMING) -(CHATTERING) We best be keepin' a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph? We wouldn't want him strayin' into things he shouldn't. We're all clear, Captain! Well, my friend. Are we ready to raise this creaking tub? My pleasure, Captain. All hands to stations! Smartly now! Come on, you scurvy scum! I'll race you! Loose all solar sails! (GRUNTING) Come on! ARROW: Heave up the braces. Brace up. Ooh! Oh! Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity. (FARTING) (CLANKING) (CLATTERING) South by southwest, Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0. Aye, Captain. 2-1 -0-0. Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please. Take her away! Brace yourself, Doctor. (SNIDELY) "Brace yourself." Aah! Oof! Whoa. (CALLING) Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus. Smile. Doctor, I'd stand clear... 'Tis a grand day for sailing, Captain, and look at you. You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint. You can keep that kind of flim-flammery for your spaceport floozies, Silver. "Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy..." You cut me to the quick, Captain. I speaks nothing but me heart at all times. MORPH: "Nothing but me heart." And, by the way, isn't that your cabin boy aimlessly footling about in those shrouds? Yep, it... A momentary aberration, Cap'n, soon to be addressed. Jimbo! I got two new friends I'd like you to meet. Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket. (LAUGHING) Yippie. Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop. Watch it, twerp. (MURMURING) What are you looking at, weirdo? Yeah, weirdo. (HISSING) Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business. Why? You got something to hide, bright eyes? Maybe your ears don't work so well. (GRUNTS) Yeah. Ahem. Too bad my nose works just fine. Why, you impudent little... (CREW SHOUTING) Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him! -(FARTING NOISE) Any last words, cabin boy? Mr. Scroop, you ever see what happens to a fresh purp when you squeeze real hard? ARROW: What's all this, then? You know the rules. There'll be no brawling on this ship. Aye-aye, sir. Any further offenders will be confined to the brig for the remainder of the voyage. Am I clear, Mr. Scroop? Transparently. SILVER: Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir! A tight ship's a happy ship, sir. Jimbo, I gave you a job. Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing... Belay that! Now, I want this deck swabbed spotless, and heaven help you if I come back and it's not done. Morph? Keep an eye on this pup, and let me know if there be any more distractions. Okay. Aye-aye (CHATTERING) (SIGHS) (CREW GRUMBLING) So, we're all here, then. Excuse me. Fine. Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen, are you all -stark-raving, totally blinking daft? -(CHATTERS) After all me finagling getting us hired as an upstanding crew, you want to blow the whole mutiny before its time? The boy was sniffing about. You just stick to the plan, you bug-brained twit. As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged, he won't have time to think. (MORPH LAUGHS) (COUGHS) (SIGHS) Well, this has been a fun day, huh? Making new friends, like that spider psycho. "Spider psycho, spider psycho." Heh. A little uglier. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) Pretty close. SILVER: Well, thank heavens for little miracles. Up here for an hour, and the deck's still in one piece. Um... Look,L“ What you did... Thanks. Didn't your pop ever teach you to pick your fights a bit more carefully? Your father not the teachin' sort? No. He was more the taking off and never coming back sort. Oh. Sorry, lad. Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine. Is that so? Well, since the captain has put you in my charge, like it or not, I'll be pounding a few skills into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble. What? From now on, I'm not letting you out of me sight. You can't do... You won't so much as eat, sleep, or scratch your bum without my say-so. Don't do me any favors! You can be sure of that, my lad. You can be sure of that. (LAUGHS) Put some elbow into it. I am a question to the world Not an answer to be heard Or a moment that's held in your arms And what do you think you'd ever say I won't listen anyway You don't know me And I'll never be what you want me to be And what do you think you'd understand? I'm a boy, no, I'm a man You can take me and throw me away And how can you learn what's never shown Yeah, you stand here on your own They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change They're the ones that stay the same They don't know me But I'm still here And you see the things they never see All you wanted I could be Now you know me And I'm not afraid And I want to tell you who I am Can you help me be a man? They can't break me As long as I know who I am They can't tell me who to be 'Cause I'm not what they see Yeah, the world is still sleeping While I keep on dreaming for me And the words are just whispers and lies That I'll never believe And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong Whoa! How can you say I never change? They're the ones that stay the same I'm the one now 'Cause I'm still here I'm the one son still here I'm still here (PULLEY SQUEAKING) (GRUNTING) You having a little trouble there? Get away from me. (LAUGHING) Oh, Jimbo. If I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age, they'd be bowing in the streets when I walked by today. "Bowing in the streets." I don't know. They weren't exactly singing my praises when I left home. Heh. Whew. -"Whew." But I'm gonna change all that. Are you now? How so? Uh... I got some plans. Gonna make people see me a little different. Ooh. Sometimes plans go astray. Not this time. Hmm. Ooh... (CHATTERS) Oh. Thank you, Morphy. So, how'd that happen anyway? You give up a few things chasing a dream. Was it worth it? Heh. (SIGHS) I'm hoping it is, Jimbo. I most surely am. (SCREAMS) (SHIP GROANS) What the devil? Good heavens. The star Pelusa, it's gone supernova! Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle! Aye-aye, Captain. All hands, fasten your lifelines! (SHOUTING) Mr. Arrow, secure those sails! Secure all sails! Reef them down, men! Yeah, baby! Ba-boom! (LAUGHS) Aah! Silver! Whoa. Thanks, lad. (YELLING) Captain, the star! It's devolving into a... (GASPS) A black hole! We're being pulled in! Ohh! No, you don't, you... Blast these waves! They're so deucedly erratic! No, Captain. They're not erratic at all. There'll be one more in precisely 47.2 seconds, followed by the biggest magilla of them all! Of course! Brilliant, Doctor! We'll ride that last magilla out of here. All sails secured, Captain! Good man! Now release them immediately! Aye, Captain. You heard her, men. Unfurl those sails. What? But we just finished... Tying them down! Make up your blooming minds! Mr. Hawkins, make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight! Aye-aye, Captain. Lifelines secured, Captain! Very good! (GASPS) Aah! DOPPLER: Captain, the last wave! Here it comes! Hold on to your lifelines, gents! It's gonna be a bumpy ride! (WHIMPERS) (BOOMING) Oof! (CREW LAUGHING) (CHEERING) (SIGHS) Captain! That... Oh, my goodness. That was... That was absolutely... That was the most... Oh, tish-tosh. Actually, Doctor, your astronomical advice was most helpful. Well, uh, uh, thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically... Amanamonically... Astronomically. Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Silver. It seems your cabin boy did a bang-up job with those lifelines. (BOTH CHUCKLE) All hands accounted for, Mr. Arrow? Mr. Arrow? I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost. His lifeline was not secured. No, I checked them all. I... I did. I checked them all They were secure. I swear. Mr. Arrow was (CLEARS THROAT) a fine spacer, finer than most of us could ever hope to be, but he knew the risks, as do we all. Resume your posts. We carry on. (WHIMPERS) It weren't your fault, you know. (SIGHS) Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss... Look, don't you get it? I screwed up! For two seconds, I thought that maybe I could do something right, but... Aagh! I just... (SIGHS) Just forget it. Forget it. Now, you listen to me, James Hawkins. You got the makings of greatness in ya, but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course. Stick to it, no matter the squalls, and when the time comes you get the chance to really test the cut of your sails and show what you're made of, well, I hope I'm there catching some of the light coming off ya that day. (SNIFFLES) (sOBS SOFTLY) There, there. Lad, it's all right, Jimbo. It's all right. Now, Jim, I... I best be getting about my watch, and you best be getting some shut-eye. (CHATTERING) Getting in too deep here, Morphy. Next thing ya know, they'll be saying I've gone soft. (CREW SNORING) (MUTTERING) (FART NOISES) Uh-oh! Oh! Ugh! (SIGHS) Morph? Morph, knock it off. It's too early for this. Ow! Hey, Morph! Pbbt! (LAUGHS) Hey, come back here! -"Come back here!" Gotcha! (SIGHS) That's it, you little squid. "You little squid. You little squid. "Squid. squid. squid. squid." (GRUNTING) Ha! Busted! Look, what we're saying is, we're sick of all this waiting. There's only three of them left. We are wanting to move. We don't move till we got the treasure in hand. I say we kill 'em all now. I say what's to say! Disobey my orders again, like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow, and so help me, you'll be joining him! Strong talk, but I know otherwise. SILVER: You got something to say, Scroop? It's that boy. Methinks you have a soft spot for him. SAILORS: Yeah Now, mark me, the lot of ya. I care about one thing, and one thing only! Flint's trove. You think I'd risk it all for the sake of some nose-wiping little whelp? SCROOP: What was it now? "Oh, you got the makings of greatness in ya." Shut your yap! I cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent. But I ain't gone soft. ONUS: Land ho! (LAUGHING) There it is! Feast eyes and click heels, if you got 'em. Where the devil's me glass? Jimbo. Playing games, are we? Yeah. Yeah, we're playing games. Oh, I see. Well, I was never much good at games Always hated to lose. (CLICK) Hmm. Me, too! Aah! Right-0. Ohh. Blast it all. (BLOWS WHISTLE) Change in plan, lads! We move now! (CHEERING) Strike our colors, Mr. Onus. With pleasure, Captain. (ROARS) Pirates on my ship? I'll see they all hang. Doctor, familiar with these? Oh, I've seen... Well, I've read... Uh, no. No. No, I'm not. Ooh. Mr. Hawkins! Defend this with your life. Morph! Give me that! You're taking all day about it. Oh! Stop them! DOPPLER: Aah, aah, aah. Oof! Hey, you! To the longboats, quickly! (GRUNTS) Yeah! Morph! No! Chew on this, you pus-filled boils! (SCREAMING) Did you actually aim for that? You know, actually, I did. (GEARS TURNING) Oh, blast it. Doctor, when I say "now," shoot out the forward cable. I'll take this one. JIM: Morph, here! Morph! SILVER: Morph! Morphy, come here. (WHISTLES) Morph. Morph. Bring it here. Morph, come here. Come here. Come here, boy. Come to your dad. JIM: Come here, boy. Morph! Come on! Morph! Morph, here! SILVER: Morphy! Morph! (GROANS) Ohh. (POWERS UP) (BEEPING) (SIGHS) Now! Whoa! (GRUNTS) Jim! Parameters met. Hydraulics engaged. That's it! Come to papa! Hold your fire! We'll lose the map! Captain! Laser ball at 12 o'clock! Whoa! Aah! (CREAKING) Ow. Oh, my goodness. That was more fun than I ever want to have again. (LAUGHING) That's not one of my gossamer landings. Captain! Oh. Ooh. Oh, don't fuss. Uh... uh... Slight bruising. That's all. Cup of tea, and I'll be right as rain. Mr. Hawkins. The map, if you please. Ah. -(GIGGLING) Morph! Morph, where's the map? Are you serious? It's back on the ship? Stifle that blob and get low. We've got company. We need a more defensible position. Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead. Aye, Captain. Unh! Steady, steady. Now, let's have a look at that. (MORPH CHATTERING) (GASPS) Shh. Shh. (POWERS UP) Aah! Aah! This is fantastic! A carbon-based life form come to rescue me at last! I just want to hug you and squeeze you and hold you close to me. All right. Okay. Would you just let go of me? Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. It's just I've been marooned for so long. I mean, solitude's fun. Don't get me wrong. For heaven's sakes, after a hundred years, you go a little nuts! Ha, ha, ha! I'm sorry. Am I... lam, um... My name is, uh... (CUCKOOING) B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N. Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops. And you are? Jim. Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy. It's Jim. Anyway... Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay? I got to find a place to hide, and there's pirates chasing me. Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates! I don't like them. I remember Captain Flint. This guy had such a temper. Wait, wait, wait. You knew Captain Flint? I think he suffered from mood swings, personally. I'm not a therapist, and anyway, but I... You let me know when I'm rambling. But that means... But wait. But then you gotta know about the treasure? Treasure? Yeah, Flint's trove? You know, loot of a thousand worlds. It's, well... lt'$ all a little... Little... Little fuzzy. Wait. I... I remember. I do. I... Treasure! Lots of treasure buried in the centroid... Centroid... Centroid of the mechanism. And there was this big door opening and closing, and opening and closing, and Captain Flint wanted to make sure nobody could ever get to his treasure, So I helped him. (SPLUTTERING) Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot! JIM: B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.! Reboot! Aah! And you are? Wait, wait, wait! What about the treasure? I want to say Larry. The centroid of the mechanism, or... I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be. I've lost my mind. I've lost my mind. You haven't found it, have you? My missing piece? My primary memory circuit? Look, B.E.N., I really need to find a place to hide, okay? So I'm just gonna be, you know, moving on. Oh, uh... So, well, then, I guess this is good-bye, huh? I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional. So, uh, go ahead and... I do understand. I do. Bye-bye. (WHINES) (SIGHS) Look, if you're gonna come along, you're gonna have to stop talking. Huzzah! Ha, ha, ha! Oh, this is fantastic! Me and my best buddy out lookin' for a... (CLEARS THROAT) (WHISPERING) Being quiet. And you have to stop touching me. Touching and talking. That's my two big no-nos. Okay. Now, I think that we should... Say, listen, before we go out on our big search, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place? (CHUCKLES) Kind of urgent. JIM: B.E.N., I think you just solved my problem. B.E.N.: Pardon the mess, people. You'd think in 100 years I would've dusted a little more often, but, you know, when you're batchin' it, you tend to let things go. Aw. Isn't that sweet? I find old-fashioned romance so touching, don't you? How about drinks for the happy couple? Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no. Thank you, we don't drink, and we're not a couple. Ahem. Look at these markings. They're identical to the ones on the map. I suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants of an ancient culture. CAPTAIN AMELIA; Mr. Hawkins, stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh! Yes, yes. Now listen to me, stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still. Very forceful, Doctor. Go on. Say something else. Hey, look! There's some more of your buddies! Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas! Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh! SILVER: Stop wastin' your fire! Hello, up there! Jimbo? If it's all right with the captain, I'd like a short word with ya. No tricks, just a little palaver. Come to bargain for the map, doubtless. Pestilential... Ugh! Captain. That means that he thinks we still have it. Morphy! I wondered where you lit off to. (GROANING) Ooh. Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky, since that game attack we had in the galley. (CHUCKLES) Ahh. Whatever you heard back there, at least the part concerning you, I didn't mean a word of it. If that bloodthirsty lot had thought I'd gone soft, they'd have gutted us both. Listen to me. If we play our cards right, we can both walk away from this rich as kings. Yeah? -(CHUCKLES) You get me that map, and an even portion of the treasure is yours. B03' You are really something. All that talk of greatness, light coming off my sails, what a joke. Now, just see here, Jimbo... I mean, at least you taught me one thing. Stick to it, right? Well, that's just what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make sure that you never see one drabloon of my treasure! That treasure is owed me, by thunder! Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder! Oh, you still don't know how to pick your fights, do you, boy? Now, mark me. Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow, or so help me, I'll use the ship's cannons to blast ya all to kingdom come! Morph, hop to it. Now! Oh, blast it! Gentlemen, we must stay together and... And... Ohh. And What? What? We must stay together and what? Doctor, you have wonderful eyes. She's lost her mind! Well, you gotta help her. Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer, not a doctor. I mean, I am a doctor, but I'm not that kind of doctor. I have a doctorate. It's not the same thing. You can't help people with a doctorate. You just sit there, and you're useless. It's okay, Doc. It's all right. Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this. It's just Jimmy has this knowledge of things. Jim, any thoughts at all? Without the map, we're dead. If we try to leave, we're dead. If we stay here... -"We're dead! "We're dead! We're dead!" Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time. Heh. So I'll just slip out the back door. Back door? Oh, yeah. I get this delightful breeze through here, which I think is important, because ventilation among friends... JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff? B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet? Not a clue. Hey, Doc! Doc! I think I found a way out of here! No, no. Jim, wait. The captain ordered us to stay... I'll be back. Cannonball! Woof. (SNORING) So, what's the plan? Shh. B.E.N., quiet. (WHISPERING) Okay, here it is. We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons, and bring back the map. (MUFFLED) That's a good plan. I like that plan. The only thing is, I'm wondering, how do we get there? On that. Aah! B.E.N., Shh! Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Okay, I'll get the map. You wait here. Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir! B.E.N.! B.E.N.! (SINGING) Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me -(HUMMING) -(SIGHS) Disable a few laser cannons. What is the big deal? All we gotta do is find that one little wire. (GASPS) Oh, mama. (SIGHS) Yes. -(ALARM BLARING) Bad, B.E.N. Bad. Okay, fixing. That stupid robot's gonna get us all... Killed. Cabin boy. (GASPS) (GROWLING) (SQUEALING) (POWERS UP) B.E.N.: Whoops. Okay, don't panic. Breathing in, breathing out... Aah! Hmm? This has gotta be cannons. Maybe not. (GRUNTING) Heh, heh. Come on, come on, come on No! (SNICKERS) Oh, yes. Do say hello to Mr. Arrow. (GASPS) Tell him yourself! (SCREAMS) Back you go, you naughty plug! Oh! (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (RATTLING) (COUGHING) Morph? -(CHATTERS) B.E.N.: Laser cannons disconnected, Captain Jimmy, sir! Gee, that wasn't so tough. Doc! Doc, wake up! I got the map. Fine work, Jimbo. Fine work indeed. (MUFFLED YELLING) Thanks for showing us the way, boy. Aah! (MORPH YELPING) What's this sorry stack of metal? Not the face! You're just like me, Jimbo Ya hates to lose. (CHUCKLES) What the devil's the... Open it. I'd get busy. (CREW MURMURING) Oh, the powers that be. Would you look? (LAUGHING) Tie him up and leave him with the others till we... What? You want the map, you're taking me, too. (GROANS) Hmm. (CHUCKLES) We'll take 'em all. (GRUNTS) (CHATTERING) It's okay, Morph. It's okay. Jimmy, I don't know about you, but I'm starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes. At least, I think it's my life. Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe? B.E.N., shh. This isn't over yet. SILVER: We're gettin' close, lads. I smell treasure a-waitin'. Huh? Where is it? I see nothing! One great, big stinking hunk of nothing! What's going on, Jimbo? I don't know. I can't get it open. We should've never followed this boy! Hey! SILVER: I'd suggest you get that gizmo going again, and fast! Let's rip his gizzard right out, right now! Throw him off the cliff! (RUMBLING) Oh, have mercy. JIM: The Lagoon Nebula? But that's halfway across the galaxy. JIM: A big door, opening and closing. Let's see. Kinapis. Montressor spaceport. So that's how Flint did it. He used this portal to roam the universe, stealing treasure. But where'd he stash it all? Where's that blasted treasure? Treasure! Treasure! It's buried in the... Buried in the centroid of the mechanism. What if the whole planet is the mechanism, and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet? (SHOUTING) And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there? Just open the right door. (ALARM BEEPING) Wait for me! Wait for me! (GASPS) (CHEERING) The loot of a thousand worlds. ONUS: We are going to need a bigger boat! (LAUGHING) This is all seeming very familiar. I can't remember why. B.E.N., come on. We're getting out of here, and we're not leaving empty-handed. But... But, Jimmy! Jimmy! A lifetime of searching. And at long last, I can touch it. Do you know what's strange? I can't tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy, 'cause there's something just... It's nagging at the back of my mind. Aah! Captain Flint? In the flesh! Well, sort of, except for skin, organs, or anything that, that... That resembles flesh, that's not there. And yet it's so odd, you know? I remember there was something horrible Flint didn't want anyone else to know, but I just can't remember what it was. Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose! (SOBBING) B.E.N., I think I just found your mind. Hold still. Aah! Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold. Whoa! Hello. You know, Jimmy, I was just thinking I was just think... It's all flooding back! All my memories! Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits, so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap! (CRASHING) Speaking of which... Huh? Flint wanted to make sure that nobody could ever steal his treasure, so he rigged this whole planet to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite! (YELLING) Run, Jimmy! Run for your life! You go back and help the captain and Doc! If I'm not there in 5 minutes, leave without me. I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy. Unless he looks at me like that. Bye, Jim! No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no! No! Aah! Aah! (CREW YELLING) Come back here, ya blighters! (RUMBLING) All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this. (SIGHS) I'm just sorry I couldn't have been more helpful to you. Oh, don't be daft. You've been very helpful. Truly. I feel like such a useless weakling with abnormally thin wrists. Excuse me, brutish pirate. (BELCHES) Yes, you. I have a question. Is it that your body is too massive for your teeny-tiny head, or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny for your big, fat body? L pummel you good! Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do, I have one more question. Is this yours? Uhh... Yes! Morph, we are so out of here! (CACKLING) Ah, Jimbo! Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe? Get back! I like you, lad, but I've come too far to let you stand between me and me treasure. JIM: Aah! Oh, no, you don't! (CHATTERING) What? Jimbo. Reach for me now! Reach! L. I can't! L. (SIGHS) Oh, blast me for a fool! (YELLS) (GROANS) Silver, you gave UP? Just a lifelong obsession, Jim. I'll get over it. B.E.N.: Aloha, Jimmy! Hurry, people! We got exactly two minutes and 34 seconds till planet's destruction! You're doing fine, Doctor. Now ease her over gently... Gently! Aah! We were better off on exploding planet! Take us out of here, metal man! Ave, Captain! Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of... Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver! (CHUCKLES) Mizzen sail demobilized, Captain! Thrusters at only 30% of capacity. 30%? That means we're... We'll never clear the planet's explosion in time. We gotta turn around. What? There's a portal back there. It can get us out of here! DOPPLER: Pardon me, Jim, but didn't that portal open onto a raging inferno? Yes, but I'm gonna change that. I'm gonna open a different door. Captain, really, I don't see how this is possible... Listen to the boy! One minute, 29 seconds till planet's destruction! What do you need, Jim? Just some way to attach this. All right. Stand back. Stand back, now. There you go. There you go. Okay. Now, no matter what happens, keep the ship heading straight for that portal. B.E.N.: Fifty-eight seconds! Well, you heard him! Get this blasted heap turned 'round! Doctor, head us back to the portal. Aye, Captain. Go to the right! The right! I know, I know! Will you just let me drive? Twenty-five seconds! No! No! Come on, lad. Seventeen seconds! B.E.N.: Seven, six, five, four, three, two... Wow! Yeah! SILVER: You done it, Jimmy! You done it, boy! Ha, ha, ha! Didn't I say the lad had greatness in him? (CHEERING) Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective. I'd be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy. They could use a man like you. Just wait until your mother hears about this! Of course, we may downplay the life-threatening parts. Jimmy, that was unforgettable! I know you don't like touching, but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya! (LAUGHING) Hey, you hugged me back. Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry. (SOBBING) Does anyone have a tissue? (MORPH SQUEAKING) Morphy, we gotta make tracks. I know. JIM: You never quit, do you? Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha! I was merely checking to make sure our last longboat was safe and secure. Mmm. Well, that should hold it. I taught you too well. If you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison. Little Morphy here, he's a free spirit. Being in a cage, it'd break his heart. Oh! What say you ship out with us, lad? You and me, Hawkins and Silver, full of ourselves and no ties to anyone! You know, when I got on this boat, I would've taken you up on that offer in a second, but, uh, I met this old cyborg, and he taught me that I could chart my own course. That's what I'm gonna do. And what do you see off that bow of yours? A future. (CHUCKLES) why, look at ya, glowing like a solar fire. You're something special, Jim. You're gonna rattle the stars, you are. (CLEARS THROAT) Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine. (SNIFFLES) (SOBBING) Oh, hey, Morph. I'll see ya around, okay? "See ya around." Morphy, I got a job for ya. I need you to keep an eye on this here pup. Will ya do me that little favor? Aye-aye, Captain. Oh, and one more thing. This is for your dear mother, to rebuild that inn of hers. Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag. (LAUGHS) Why, Jimbo, lad, when have I ever done otherwise? (LAUGHING) (CHEERING) (YAWNS) (ALL GASP) (ALL CHEER) (PLAYING MUSIC) (CRYING) (LAUGHING) It's good to see the sun And feel this place This place I never thought Would feel like home And I ran forever Far away And I always thought I'd end up here alone Somehow The world has changed And I've come home To give you back the things They took from you And I feel you now I'm not alone I always know Where you are When I see myself I always know Where you are Where you are And I found something That was always there Sometimes it's got to hurt Before you feel But now I'm strong And I won't kneel Except to thank Who's watching over me And somehow I feel so strong And I've begun To be the one I never thought I'd be And I feel you now I'm not alone I always know Where you are And When I See Myself I always know Where you are Where you are Now it's all so clear And I believe That everything's been Opened up to me And I feel you now I'm not alone I always know I always know Where you are And when I see myself I always know Where you are And when I feel the sun I always know Where you are And when I see myself I always know Where you are Where you are (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Please rate this subtitle at www.osdb.link/482gs
