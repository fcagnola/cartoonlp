The second star to the right Shines in the night for you To tell you that the dreams you plan Really can come true The second star to the right Shines with a light so rare And if it's Never Land you need Its light will lead you there Twinkle, twinkle little star So we'll know where you are Gleaming in the skies above Lead us to the land We dream of And when our journey is through Each time we say Good night We'll thank the little star that shines The second from The right All this has happened before. And it will all happen again. But this time it happened in London. It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury. That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family. And Peter Pan chose this particular house because there were people here who believed in him. There was Mrs Darling. George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't be late for the party, you know. Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth. But Mr Darling... Mary, unless I find my cuff links we don't go to the party. And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again. And if I can never... Well, Mr Darling was a practical man. The boys, however, John and Michael, believed Peter Pan was a real person and made him the hero of all their nursery games. Blast you, Peter Pan! Take that! Give up, Captain Hook? Give up? Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand! Oh, no, John. It was the left hand. Yes. Thank you, Wendy. Wendy, the eldest, not only believed, she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan and all his marvellous adventures. Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic? Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog, kept her opinions to herself and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance. Take that! Insolent boy! I'll slash you to ribbons! And I'll cut you to pieces. Careful, Michael, my glasses. I'm sorry, John. You'll never leave this ship alive! Oh, yes, I will. Take that! Scuttle me bones, boy, I'll slit your gizzard. Oh, no, you won't. Back, back, back, you villain! Insolent pup! Wicked pirate! I got ya. You didn't either. You never touched me. Take that and that! And that! Boys, boys, less noise, please. Oh, hello, Father. You old bilge rat. What? Now, see here, Michael... Not you, Father. You see, he's Peter Pan. And John's Captain Hook. Yes, yes, of course. Have you seen my cuff... Nana, for goodness sake! Where are those cuff links? Cuff links, Father? Yes, the gold ones. Michael, the buried treasure. Where is it? I don't know. The map then. Where's the treasure map? It got lost. Good heavens, my shirt front! Hurray! You found it! You found it! Yes, so I have. And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael. This is my last clean... No! No! George, dear, we must hurry or we'll be... Mary, look! George. It's only chalk, Father. Why, Michael. It's not his fault. It's in the story. And Wendy says... Wendy? Story? I might have known. Wendy! Wendy! Yes, Father? Would you kindly ex... Oh, Mother! You look simply lovely. Thank you, dear. Wendy. Just my old gown made over. But it did turn out rather nicely... Mary, if you don't mind. Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt? What have I... Now, George, really. It comes right off. That's no excuse. Wendy, haven't I warned you? Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories. Oh, but they aren't. I say they are! Captain Crook! Peter Pirate! Peter Pan, Father. Pan! Pirate! Poppycock! No, Father. You don't understand. Absolute poppycock! And let me tell you, this ridiculous... Now, George. "Now, George." "Now, George!" Well, "Now, George," will have his say! Please, dear. Mary, the child's growing up. It's high time she had a room of her own. Father! George! What? No! I mean it! Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery. And that's my last word on the matter... No! No! Poor Nana. "Poor Nana?" This is the last straw! Out! Out, I say! No, Father, no! Yes! There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house! Goodbye, Nana. "Poor Nana." Oh, yes, "Poor Nana." But "Poor Father?" Oh, no! Blast it! Where is that rope? Thank you. Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that. It's nothing personal. It's just that Well, you're not really a nurse at all. You're... Well, a dog. And the children aren't puppies. They're people. And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up. But, Mother, I don't want to grow up. Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight. He called Peter Pan "absolute poppycock." I'm sure he didn't mean it, John. Father was just upset. Poor Nana, out there all alone. No more tears, Michael. It's a warm night. She'll be all right. Mother. What is it, dear? Buried treasure. Now, children. Don't judge your father too harshly. After all, he really loves you very much. Don't lock it, Mother. He might come back. -"He?" Yes, Peter Pan. You see, I found something that belongs to him. And what's that? His shadow. "Shadow?" Nana had it. But I took it away. Yes, of course. Good night, dear. But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana? Safe? Of course they'll be safe. Why not? Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I... Shadow? Whose shadow? Peter Pan's. Peter Pan... Peter Pan! You don't say. Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do? But, George... Sound the alarm! Call Scotland Yard! There must have been someone. Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle. Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical... George... -...when you're as bad as they are. No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas. Over there, Tink, in its den. Is it there? Must be here somewhere. Tink! Stop playing and help me find my shadow. Shadow. Oh, shadow. Peter Pan! Oh, Peter! I knew you'd come back. I saved your shadow for you. I do hope it isn't rumpled. You look exactly the way I thought you would. A little taller perhaps. But then... You can't stick it on with soap, Peter. It needs sewing. That's the proper way to do it. Come to think of it, I've never thought about it, sewing shadows. I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it. I said to myself, "I'll put it away for him until he comes back. "He's sure to come back." And you did, didn't you, Peter? After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later. Don't you agree? What I don't understand is how Nana got it in the first place. She really isn't... Sit down. It won't take long. She really isn't vicious. She's a wonderful nurse. Father says... Girls talk too much. Yes, girls talk too... Well, get on with it, girl. My name is Wendy. Wendy Moira Angela Darl... Wendy's enough. But how did Nana get your shadow, Peter? Jumped at me the other night at the window. Well, what were you doing there? I came to listen to the stories. My stories? But they're all about you. Of course. That's why I like 'em. I tell 'em to the Lost Boys. The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember. They're your men. I'm so glad you came back tonight. I might never have seen you. Why? Because I have to grow up tomorrow. Grow up! Tonight's my last night in the nursery. But that means no more stories. No! I won't have it. Come on! But where are we going? To Never Land. Never Land! You'll never grow up there. Peter, it will be so wonderful. But wait. What would Mother say? Mother? What's Mother? Why, Peter, a mother is someone who... Who loves and cares for you -and tells you stories. Good! You can be our mother. Come on. Now, just a minute, I... Let me see now. I have to pack. And I must leave a note when I'll be back. I couldn't stay too long. And then I'll have to... Oh, but Never Land. I'm so happy I-- I think I'll give you a kiss. What's a kiss? Well, I'll show you. Stop! Stop it, Tink! John, John, wake up! He's here. Jiminy! What in the world was that? Tinker Bell. Don't know what got into her. Hello, Peter Pan. I'm Michael. And my name is John. How do you do? Hello. Look, a firefly. A pixie. Amazing! What's the pixie doing? Talking. What did she say? She says you're a big, ugly girl. Well, I think she's lovely. Well, come on, Wendy, let's go. Where are we going? To Never Land. Never Land! Peter's taking us. -"Us?" Well, of course. I couldn't go without Michael and John. I should like very much to cross swords with real buccaneers. Yes, and fight pirates too. Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders. Aye, aye, sir. Me too. But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land? Fly, of course. Fly? It's easy. All you have to do is to... ls to... That's funny. What's the matter? Don't you know? Sure. It's just that I never thought about it before. Say, that's it! You think of a wonderful thought. Any happy, little thought? Any happy, little thought? Like toys at Christmas? Sleigh bells, snow? Yep! Watch me now. Here I go! It's easier than pie. He can fly! He can fly! He flewed! Now you W I'll think of a mermaid lagoon, underneath a magic moon. I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave. I think I'll be an Indian brave. Now everybody try. One, two, three! We can fly! We can fly! We can fly! This won't do. What's the matter with you? All it takes is faith and trust. And something I forgot. Dust! Dust? Dust? Yep. Just a little bit of pixie dust. Now, think of the happiest things. It's the same as having wings. Let's all try it just once more. Look! We're rising off the floor. Jiminyl Oh, my! We can fly! You can fly! We can fly! Come on, everybody. Here we go! Off to Never Land! Think of a wonderful thought Any merry little thought Think of Christmas Think of snow Think of sleigh bells Off you go like reindeer in the sky You can fly, you can fly You can fly Think of the happiest things It's the same as having wings Take the path that moonbeams make If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye You can fly, you can fly You can fly Up you go with a heigh and ho To the stars beyond the blue There's a Never Land waiting for you Where all your happy dreams come true Every dream that you dream will come true Come on, Nana! When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all the joy you'll find When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly You can fly There it is, Wendy. Second star to the right and straight on till morning. When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all the joy you'll find when you leave the world behind And bid your cares goodbye You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly, you can fly Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life A-rovin' over the sea Give me a career as a buccaneer It's the life of a pirate for me, oh The life of a pirate for me Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life They never bury your bones For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones Oh, my good friend, Davy Jones Good morning, shipmates. And what's good about it, Mr Smee? Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island. While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan. Look out. It might go off. We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships. Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat. Better hop it. And tell the captain we wants to put to sea, see? Peter Pan... Blast that Peter Pan! If I could only find his hideout, I'd trap him in his lair. But where is it? Mermaid Lagoon? No, we've searched that. We've combed Cannibal Cove. Here! No. No, no, no! That's Indian terri... But wait. Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship. I wonder. Good morning, captain. I've got it! Tiger Lily, Smee! Tiger Lily, captain? The chief's daughter. She'll know where Pan is hiding. But will she talk, captain? A little persuasion might be in order. Now let me see. Boiling in oil? Keelhauling? Marooning? A pirate's life is a wonderful life You'll find adventure and sport But live every minute for all that is in it The life of a pirate is short Oh, the life... Now let me see, where was I? Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook. Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza? It ain't good form, you know. "Good form," Mr Smee? Blast good form! Did Pan show good form when he did this to me? Why, captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say. Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile! That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well, he's followed me ever since, licking his chops for the rest of me. And he'd have had you by now, captain, if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock. But now when he's about, he warns ya, as ya might say, with his tick-took, tick-took, tick-took Smee? Smee! Save me, Smee! Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Please, don't let him get me, Smee! Smee! Here now, shame on ya. Upsettin' the poor captain. There'll be no handouts today. Shoo now, shoo! Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya, I say, go away, go away, out of here. Is he gone, Smee? Aye, captain, all clear. Nothin' to worry about. Oh, Smee, Smee. I can't stand it any longer. I tell you, I can't. Now, now, now, now, captain. Just relax. What you need is a shave. A nice, soothing shave. There now. Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life A-sailing over the sea Give me a career as a... Captain, you know, I can't help noticin' you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late. Give me a career as a buccaneer The crew's gettin' a might uneasy, captain. That is, what's left of it. Now, why don't we put to sea, see? Leave Never Land. Forget Peter Pan. There now! Give me a career as a buccaneer We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier. Captain? Oh, dear! I never shaved him this close before. Now, don't worry, captain. It must be somewhere about. Get up, you idiot! Aye, aye, sir. I found it, captain. Good as new. Why, you blithering blockhead! Peter Pan ahoy! What? What? Where away? Three points off the starboard bow! Swoggle me eyes! It is Pan! Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats! Mr Smee, pipe up the crew! Aye, aye, sir. Pipe up the crew. All hands on deck! All hands on deck! All hands on deck! All hands on deck! Look alive, you swabs! We've got him this time, Mr Smee. That we have, captain. Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats! I've waited years for this. Not countin' holidays either. Double the powder, shorten the fuse! Shorten the powder, double the fuse! A pretty sight, Mr Smee. We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks. All right, men! Range 42. Range 42. Elevation 65. Elevation 65. Three degrees west. Three degrees west. Steady now! Steady! Peter, it's just as I've always dreamed it would be. Look, John, there's Mermaid Lagoon. By Jove! And the Indian encampment! Look, there's Captain Hook and the pirates. Look out! Take Wendy and the boys to the island. I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire. Hook! Hook! You codfish! Here! Tinker Bell? Not so fast. Please, Tinker Bell. We can't keep up with you. Tinker Bell!

Come on, Wendy, I'll show you the island. Peter, the mermaids? Let's go huntin'! Tigers? Naw, bears. Naw, bears. Personally, I prefer to see the aborigines. And the Indians too. All right, men! Go out and capture a few Indians. John, you be the leader. I shall try to be worthy of my post. Forward! March! Come on, bear. Michael, do be careful. Come on, Wendy. I'll show you the mermaids.

A plan of attack. The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus! John! Indians! Indians! Let me in! Remember, the Indian is cunning... Hey... -...but not intelligent. Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise. I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps. It's all my fault. That's all right, Wildcat. We don't mind. That's okay. How. How, chief! How. For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys. Sometime you win. Sometime we win. Okay, chief. You win this time. Now turn us loose. "Turn us loose?" You mean this is only a game? Sure! When we win, we turn them loose. When they win, they turn us loose. This time, no turn 'em loose. The chief's a great spoof er. Me no spoof 'em. Where you hide Princess Tiger Lily? Tiger Lily? We ain't got your old princess. I've never seen her. Me neither. Honest, we don't. Heap big lie. If Tiger Lily not back by sunset, burn 'em at stake. Just imagine, real live mermaids. Would you like to meet 'em? Peter, I'd love to. All right, come on. It's Peter. Hello, Peter! Hello, Peter! Hello, Peter! Hello, girls. I'm so glad to see you. Why did you stay away so long? Did you miss me? Tell us one of your adventures. Something exciting. Want to hear about the time I cut off Hook's hand? I've always liked that one. Me too. There I was on Marooner's Rock surrounded... Peter! Who's she? Her? Oh, that's Wendy. A girl? What's she doing here? And in her nightdress too. Come on, dearie. Join us for a swim. I'm not dressed for it. But you must! We insist! No, please! Too good for us? Peter! If you dare to come near me again... Wendy! Wendy! They were just having a little fun, weren't you? That's all. We were only trying to drown her. Ya see? Well, if you think for one minute that I'm going to put up with a... Hold it, Wendy. Yep, it's Hook. Hook! Hook! Quick, Wendy. They've captured Tiger Lily. Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock. Come on, Wendy. Let's see what they're up to. Now, me dear princess, this is me proposition. You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan, and I shall set you free. You dog. Poor Tiger Lily. Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee? Oh, yes. Always, captain. You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in and then it will be too late. I'll show the old codfish. Stay here, and watch the fun. Fun? Remember, there is no path through water to the happy hunting ground. This is your last chance, Tiger Lily! Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak! Beware, Captain Hook! Beware! Beware! Did you hear that, Smee? It's an evil spirit, captain. Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around. Spirit of the great seawater, is it? Wendy. Watch this. Mr Smee! Yes, captain? Release the princess and take her back to her people. Aye, aye, sir. Release the princess... But, captain... Those are me orders, Mr Smee! Aye, aye, sir. Captain Hook's comin' to his senses. Odd's fish! I told him you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan. And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee? Just what you told me, captain. Carryin' out your orders. My orders? Yes, captain. Didn't you just say to go... Put her back! You blithering idiot! My orders. Of all the bumbling... Mr Smee! Just exactly what do you think you are doing? Putting her back like you said, captain. I said nothing of the sort! But, captain, didn't you? I thought that... For the last time, Mr Smee. Take the princess back to her people. Understand? Aye, aye, sir. And one more thing. When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew to help themselves to me best rum. Peter! Here's your spirit, Smee! Why, it's Peter Pan. Scurvy brat! Thank you, captain. Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel. Watch this, Wendy. Oh, Peter, do be careful. Try your luck, Mr Smee? Let him have it! Well, come on, you idiot! Blast him! Right here, Mr Smee. Hold it, you fool! No! No! Captain? How dreadful. What a pity, Mr Smee. I'm afraid we've lost the dear captain. Captain! In the back, captain? Give it to him, captain! Cleave him to the brisket! I've got you this time, Pan. Well, well, a codfish on a hook. I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do! I say, captain, do you hear something? No. No! No! Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish? You do? Oh, Peter, no! No! Smee! Don't go away, captain! Stay right there now, sir. I'll save ya, sir. Smee! Smee! Smee! Captain! Captain! Smee! Smee! Give him back! Smee... Row for the ship! Row for the ship... Smee! Peter, what about Tiger Lily? Tiger Lily? Oh, Tiger Lily. Help... Peter. Wait for me. That cursed Peter Pan. Making a fool out of me. Oh, my head. Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life Your hot water, Mr Smee. The poor captain has a splitting headache. We mustn't annoy him. Well, captain, it's nice to see you smiling again. Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life. Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats. Captain, why don't we put to sea again? You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island. Women trouble. I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but the cook told me that the first mate told him that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell. Why, you doddering imbecile, I... Did you say Pan has banished Tinker Bell? Aye, aye, captain. He has. But why? Well, on account of Wendy, captain Tink tried to do her in, she did. Tink's terrible jealous. Well, well. That's why we ought to leave, captain. This ain't no place for a respectable pirate. That's it, Smee! That's it! I'm glad you agrees, captain. Quick, me coat. Me best dress coat. Aye, aye, sir. The sooner we get going, the better. Yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything My case of hooks! Aye, aye, sir. Here you are, sir. Your Sunday set. If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her, the wench may chart our course to a certain hiding place. Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir. I'll set our course... And where do you think you are going? To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir. You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell and bring her to me. Understand? Aye, aye, sir. How. How. What's the chief doing, John? He's delivering an oration in sign language. What's he saying? He says, "Peter Pan, mighty warrior. "Save Tiger Lily. "Make big chief heap glad." Well, he certainly doesn't look "heap glad." Make Peter Pan heap big chief. You now Little Flying Eagle. Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle! Hurray! How wonderful! Hurray! Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man. Good, this should be most enlightening. Hey, what makes the red man red? When did he first say, "Ugh?" Why does he ask you, "How?" "Why does he ask you, 'How'?" Why does he ask you, "How?" Once the Injun didn't know all the things that he know now But the Injun he sure learn a lot And it's all from asking how We translate for you Hana means what mana means and ganda means that too Squaw, no dance. Squaw, get 'em firewood. When did he first say, "Ugh?" When did he first say, "Ugh?" In the Injun book, it say when first brave married squaw He gave outwith heap big "ugh" when he saw his mother-in-law What made the red man red? Let's go back a million years to the very first Injun prince He kissed a maid and start to blush and we've all been blushin' since Now you've got it right from the head man The real true story of the red man No matter what's been written or said Now you know why the red man's red John! Squaw take 'em papoose. Michael! Squaw, get 'em firewood. Squaw no get 'em firewood! Squaw go home. Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell, but Captain Hook would like a word with ya. Yes, Miss Bell, Captain Hook admits defeat. Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return. I'm glad to hear that, captain. I'll tell the crew and... And that's why I asked you over, me dear, to tell Peter I bear him no ill will. Pan has his faults, to be sure. Bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance. Dangerous business, that. Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter. But what's this? Tears? Then it is true. Smee. The way of a man with a maid. Taking the best years of her life and then casting her aside like an old glove! Ain't it a bloomin' shame? But we mustn't judge Peter too harshly, me dear It's that Wendy who's to blame. Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself. But how? We've so little time. We sail in the morning. Sail! That's it, Smee! We'll shanghai Wendy. "Shanghai Wendy," captain? Take her to sea with us. With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation. Come, Smee, we must leave immediately. Surround Peter's home... But, captain, we... We don't know where Peter Pan lives! Great Scott, you're right, Smee! What's that, my dear? You could show us the way? Why, I never thought of that. Take this down, Smee. -"Take this down, Smee." Aye, aye, captain. Start at Pegleg Point. -"Start at Pegleg Point." Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff. "Blindman's Bluff." Yes, yes. Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek Then... Nor' by nor'east, one, two, three. Well, get on with it... Continue, my dear. I mustn't harm Peter? Madam, Captain Hook gives his word not to lay a finger or a hook on Peter Pan. Hangman's Tree. So that's the entrance to his hiding place. Thank you, me dear. You've been most helpful. What makes red men red? Big Chief Flying Eagle greets his braves. How. How, chief. How, chief, how! How. How. Big chief greets little mother. How. Wendy, is that all you have to say? Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful. Especially Tiger Lily. Tiger Lily? John! Michael! Take off that war paint and get ready for bed. Bed? Brave no sleep. Go for days without sleep. But we're going home in the morning. Home! And... Wendy, we don't want to go home. No go home. Stay many moons. Have heap big time. Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical. Chief Flying Eagle has spoken. Oh, for goodness sake. Please, boys. Do you want to stay here and grow up like savages? Of course. But you can't. You need a mother. We all do. Aren't you our mother, Wendy? Michael, of course not! Surely, you haven't forgotten our real mother! Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat? Oh, no, Michael. That was Nana. I think I had a mother once. What was she like? I forget. I had a white rat! That's no mother! Hey, who ya shovin'? No, no, boys! Please. I'll tell you what a mother is. Yeah, tell us. Please, Wendy. Well, a mother, a real mother, is the most wonderful person in the world. She's the angel voice that bids you good night, kisses your cheek, whispers, "Sleep tight." Your mother And mine Your mother And mine The helping hand that guides you along Whether you're right Whether you're wrong Your mother And mine Your mother And mine What makes mothers all that they are Might as well ask What makes a star Ask your heart to tell you her worth Your heart will say Heaven on earth Another word For divine Your mother And mine I wanna see my mother. Yes, Michael. I propose we leave for home at once. Could I go too, Wendy? Me too, Wendy! All right, boys. All right. I'm sure Mother would be glad to have you. That is, if Peter doesn't mind. Go on! Go back and grow up. But I'm warning ya, once you're grown up, you can never come back. Never! Oh, dear. Well, then, shall we be off? Yeah, come on. Let's go! Yeah! See ya, Peter. They'll be back. Peter. Good bye, Peter. All right, men. Take them away. And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan. But, captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat? Aye, that it would, Mr Smee. But I have given me word not to lay a finger... Or a hook on Peter Pan. And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.

Oh, no, we won't. Peter Pan will save us. Peter Pan will save them, Smee. Peter Pan will save them. Oh, captain, you did it. But a thousand pardons, my dear. I don't believe you are in on our little joke. You see, we left a present for Peter. Sort of a surprise package, you might say. Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment, reading the tender inscription. "To Peter, with love from Wendy. "Do not open till 6:00." I wonder what's in it Could he but see within the package, he would find an ingenious little device. Set, so that when the clock is like this... Peter Pan will be blasted out of Never Land forever. No! But time grows short. We have but 18 seconds. Fifteen seconds. Thirteen seconds. Twelve seconds. Well, I guess I can open it now. Hey, Tink. Look what Wendy left. Hey, stop that! Stop it! What's the matter with you? Hook? A bomb? Don't be ridiculous! And so passeth a worthy opponent. Amen. Hook! It was a bomb! Why, if it hadn't been for Tink... Tinker Bell! Tink? Tinker Bell? Where are you, Tink? Tink? Tinker Bell! Tink. Are you all right? Wendy? The boys? But I've gotta save you first. Hold on, Tink! Hold on! Don't go out. Don't you understand, Tink? You mean more to me than anything in this whole world! And now, which will it be? The pen or the plank? Captain Hook, we will never join your crew As you wish. Ladies first, me dear. Good bye, boys. Goodbye, Wendy. Be brave, John. I shall strive to, Wendy. Goodbye, Michael. Goodbye, Wendy. Come on! Get along over there! Get going! Don't give us no trouble! Go on! Go on! Get it over with! Move along! The captain's waitin'! Wendy!Wendy! Captain, no splash. Not a sound. Not a bloomin' ripple. It's a jinx, that's what it is. No splash. No sign of the wench. Did you hear a splash? I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day. Mark me words. We'll all pay for this. The ship is bewitched. No splash, captain. So you want a splash, Mr Starkey. I'll give you a splash! Who's next? You're next, Hook! This time you've gone too far! It's Pan! Peter Pan! And Wendy! It can't be! It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'! Say your prayers, Hook. I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins. I'll run him through! Take that! Curse this hook! Come on, everybody! Hurry, Michael! Hurry! Don't stand there, you bilge rats! Get those scurvy brats! After the brats, men! This is no mere boy. 'Tis some fiend fighting me. A flying devil! Hold your fire. Get 'em! Steady, men. Steady. Club 'em with the marline. Fire!

No, don't, Peter! It's a trick! I give my word, Hook. Good, then let's have at it! Now! Insolent youth, prepare to die! Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly! No! I gave my word. You're mine, Hook! Cleave him to the brisket! You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad? I'll go away forever. I'll do anything you say. Well, all right. If ya say you're a codfish. I'm a codfish. Louder! I'm a codfish! Hurray! Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish Hook is a codfish... All right, Hook, you're free to go, and never return. Peter! Smee! Smee! Smee! Smee! Smee! Smee! Captain! Captain! Captain! Hurray! Hurray for Captain Pan! All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya! We're castin' off! Heave those halyards! But, Peter... That is, Captain Pan. At your service, madam. Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing? To London, madam. Peter. Michael! John! We're going home! Man the capstan! Hoist anchor! Pixie dust! George, I'm so glad you changed your mind about Wendy. After all, she's still a child. Mary, you know I never mean those things. Do I, Nana? Wendy! Wendy, what on earth are you doing there? Mother, we're back! Back? All except the Lost Boys. They weren't quite ready. Lost bo... Ready? To grow up. That's why they went back to Never Land. Never Land? Yes, but I am. "Am?l" Ready to grow up. Well, my dear, all in good time. After all, perhaps we were too... But, Mother, it was such a wonderful adventure. Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan. He was the most wonderful of all. Why, even when we were kidnapped... Kidnapped! I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did. And we all called him a codfish! Captain Hook, I mean. And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky. Mary, I'm going to bed. Oh, Mother. He really is wonderful, isn't he? See how well he sails the ship. George. George! Now what, Mary? Nana, did you see... You know, I have the strangest feeling that I've seen that ship before. A long time ago, when I was very young. George, dear. Father. When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all the joy you'll find When you leave the world behind And bid your cares goodbye You can fly You can fly
