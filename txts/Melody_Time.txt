WE'LL HAVE MORE FUN SLEIGHING BEHIND TWO CHESTNUT MARES WHEN WE SAY "GOODBYE, DECEMBER" MERRY BELLS NO LONGER CHIME WE'LL REMEMBER ONCE UPON A WINTERTIME FREDDY MARTIN, AN ARDENT ADMIRER OF THE CLASSICS, INSPIRED BY RIMSKY-KORSAKOV'S FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE, HAS CHOSEN TO INTERPRET THIS LIVELY FANTASY IN HIS OWN UNIQUE STYLE. IN A FLIGHT THAT IS FAST AND FURIOUS, A CONFUSED LITTLE CHARACTER TRIES DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE FROM THE HECTIC HARMONY OF AN INSTRUMENTAL NIGHTMARE. [PIANO PLAYS JAZZY FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE] ON THE PAGES OF AMERICAN FOLKLORE, A LEGION OF MIGHTY MEN HAVE LEFT THE SYMBOLS OF THEIR GREATNESS. THERE WAS PAUL BUNYAN'S AX. JOHN HENRY'S HAMMER. DAVY CROCKETT'S RIFLE. AND THEN, QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY, ONE COMES UPON A TIN POT HAT, A BAG OF APPLE SEED, AND A HOLY BOOK. AND STRANGELY ENOUGH, THESE ARE THE SYMBOLS OF ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST MEN OF ALL. JOHN CHAPMAN. A REAL LIFE PIONEER. WITH THE PASSING YEARS HOWEVER, REALITY HAS GIVEN WAY TO LEGEND. UNTIL TODAY, WE KNOW THIS REMARKABLE MAN SIMPLY AS JOHNNY APPLESEED. THIS IS HIS STORY. TOLD BY AN OLD SETTLER WHO KNEW JOHNNY WELL. LISTEN. [NARRATOR] WELL, SIR, EVERY TIME I SEE AN APPLE BLOSSOM SKY, I THINK OF JOHNNY APPLESEED. 'CAUSE OF COURSE THEM CLOUDS UP THAR, THEY AIN'T REALLY CLOUDS AT ALL. NO, SIR. SHUCKS, THERE WOULDN'T BE NO APPLE BLOSSOM SKY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT THAT JOHNNY... BUT NOW HOLD ON, HERE. GUESS I BETTER START BACK TO THE BEGINNING. THAT'S WHEN JOHNNY LIVED ON A FARM, NEAR PITTSBURGH TOWN. THE YEAR WAS 1806, OR MAYBE THERE AROUND. NOW JUST TO LOOK AT HIM, YOU'D SAY JOHNNY APPLESEED NEVER WOULD MAKE A PIONEER. HE WAS SUCH A SAWED-OFF SCRAWNY LITTLE FELLA. OF COURSE, THAT DIDN'T PHASE JOHNNY NONE. SHUCKS, HE HAD HIS APPLE TREES IN THE MORNING SUN, AND THE EVENING BREEZE. [WHISTLING] THE LORD IS GOOD TO ME AND SO I THANK THE LORD FOR GIVING ME THE THINGS I NEED THE SUN AND RAIN AND AN APPLE SEED YES, HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME [WHISTLING] I OWE THE LORD SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING I SEE I'M CERTAIN IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM THERE'D BE NO APPLES ON THIS LIMB HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME OH, HERE AM I 'NEATH THE BLUE, BLUE SKY DOING AS I PLEASE SINGING WITH MY FEATHERED FRIEND HUMMING WITH THE BEES I WAKE UP EVERY DAY AS HAPPY AS CAN BE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WITH HIS CARE MY APPLE TREES THEY WILL STILL BE THERE OH, THE LORD IS GOOD TO ME WORKING, SINGING, CAREFREE AND GAY. THAT'S HOW JOHNNY SPENT EACH DAY. ATTENDING TO HIS APPLE TREES. BUT LATELY, LITTLE JOHNNY HERE WOULD FEEL A STIR IN THE AIR. A RUMBLING, ROLLING UNDERBEAT OF RESTLESS MEN WITH RESTLESS FEET. GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OUT TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OR YOU'LL BE LEFT ALONE WE'VE MADE A HOME BEFORE WE'RE STARTING OUT AGAIN WE AIN'T AFEARED OF MAN OR BEAST WE'RE STRONG-HEARTED MEN SO, GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST SEEKING A LAND THAT'S NEW GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR YOU GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OUT TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OR YOU'LL BE LEFT ALONE THE RIVERS MAY BE WIDE THE MOUNTAINS MAY BE TALL BUT NOTHING STOPS THE PIONEER WE'RE TRAIL-BLAZERS ALL GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OUT TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN GET ON THE WAGON ROLLING WEST OR... [SINGING FADES] POOR JOHNNY. HE WEREN'T NO PIONEER AND HE KNOWED IT. IT WAS ALL JUST PRETEND. AND THEM FOLKS GOING WEST TO BUILD THIS NATION SURE MADE PICKING APPLES LOOK LIKE A PLUM USELESS OCCUPATION. WELL, SIR, THAT'S WHEN A MIRACLE HAPPENED. "WELL, WHAT'S HOLDING YOU, JOHNNY?" SAYS A VOICE. GO ON. GO ON OUT WEST, IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE. WELL, SIR, IT WAS AN ANGEL. JOHNNY'S OWN PRIVATE GUARDIAN ANGEL. MIGHT LOOK MIGHTY QUEERSOME TO YOU AND ME. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST THE WAY JOHN FIGURED HE'D BE. WELL, SPEAK UP, BOY. DON'T STAND THERE GAWKIN'. UNLOCK YOUR JAW AND GET TO TALKIN'. YES, SIR. YES, SIR! WHY DON'T I GO WEST? 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT THE MUSCLE. OR THE BREADTH OF CHEST. OUT THERE, IT'S THE STRONG MEN WHO SURVIVE. I'M ABOUT THE PUNIEST FELLER ALIVE. SHAME TO YOU, JOHNNY. YOU GOT FAITH, AND COURAGE, AND A LEVEL HEAD. BUT SHUCKS, YOU SEE, SIR. ALL I KNOW IS APPLE TREES. AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH APPLES, IF YOU PLEASE? AIN'T THEY ABOUT THE FINEST FRUIT IN ALL THE LAND? WHY, SHOOT, MAN. THEY TAKE THE CAKE. JUST THINK, JOHNNY, OF ALL THE THINGS THAT APPLES MAKE. THERE'S APPLE PICKLES. OH, SO TASTY APPLE TARTS AND APPLE PASTRY APPLE DUMPLINGS, NOT TO MENTION APPLE SAUCE? YES. THERE'S APPLE FRITTERS LIGHT AS THISTLE AND FOR FOLKS TO WET THEIR WHISTLE [BOTH] TANGY APPLE CIDER IN A GLASS STEW 'EM, FRY 'EM BOIL 'EM, BAKE 'EM APPLE PIE AND APPLE CAKE 'EM YOU CAN COOK 'EM ANY WAY THERE'S APPLE THIS AND APPLE THAT THE RECIPES'D FILL YOUR HAT WHY I COULD CARRY ON LIKE THIS ALL DAY! SO, PACK YOUR STUFF AND GET A-GOIN' GET THEM APPLE TREES A-GROWIN' THERE'S A LOT OF WORK OUT THERE TO DO [BOTH] THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO YES, SIR! I MEAN, NO SIR. YOU SEE, SIR...

WHY, YOU GOT ALL THE SEEDS YOU'RE NEEDING. AND FOR PRETTY DARN GOOD READING, THERE AIN'T NOTHING FINER THAN YOUR BOOK HERE'S A MIGHTY HANDY BONNET. EVEN GOT A HANDLE ON IT. TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU CAN COOK SO, COME ON, SON AND GET A-GOIN' GET THEM APPLE TREES A-GROWIN' [BOTH] THERE'S A LOT OF WORK OUT THERE TO DO OH, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO [NARRATOR] WELL, SIR, THAT'S HOW IT ALL BEGAN. THAT'S HOW JOHNNY ALL ALONE SET OUT TO MEET THE GREAT UNKNOWN. IT WAS A MIGHTY BIG AND FEARSOME PLACE FOR A MAN TO FACE. A LITTLE MAN AND ALL ALONE. WITHOUT NO KNIFE, WITHOUT NO GUN. AND THOUGH THE FOREST IS DARK AND WIDE, WITH FEARSOME CRITTERS ON EVERY SIDE, JOHNNY JUST KEPT WALKING ON. WALKED UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A LITTLE SPOT OF OPEN GROUND. WITH FERTILE SOIL AND WARMSOME BREEZE. A LIKELY PLACE FOR APPLE TREES. NOW THE VARMINTS HERE, THEY COULDN'T KNOW IF JOHN WAS FRIEND OR JOHN WAS FOE. SO, SOME TOOK OFF IN SUDDEN FLIGHT. SOME GOT SET TO CLAW AND BITE. BUT IF JOHNNY SEEN 'EM, HE PAID NO HEED. JUST GOT BUSY PLANTING APPLE SEED. [WHISTLING] NOW THEM VARMINTS COME FROM EVERYWHERE. TO WATCH THAT MAN A-DIGGIN' THERE. DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. DIDN'T TRUST NO HUMAN BEING. YEP, THAT ORNERY HUMAN HAD TO GO. BUT WHO WAS A-GONNA TELL HIM SO? WELL, NOT A SOUL COULD ANSWER THAT. TILL HERE COME ALONG A BLACK AND WHITE CAT. NOW HE WEREN'T TOO BRIGHT, BUT HE DIDN'T MUCH CARE. HE KNOWED HE HAD A CERTAIN AIR... ABOUT HIM. WELL, SIR, THAT DONE IT. THE CRITTERS NE'ER SEEN THE BEAT OF THAT. THE LIKES OF A HUMAN LIKING THAT CAT. WHY SHUCKS, THIS LITTLE MAN HAD WENT AND BUSTED EVERY PRECEDENT. HE WAS THE VERY FIRST TO COME WITHOUT NO KNIFE, WITHOUT NO GUN. AND SO IT WAS, FROM THAT TIME ON, EVERY LAST LIVING VARMINT WAS A FRIEND TO JOHN. THEY SURELY WAS. [JOHN WHISTLING] THE LORD IS GOOD TO ME AND SO I THANK THE LORD [ECHOING] FOR GIVING ME THE THINGS I NEED THE SUN, AND RAIN AND THE APPLE SEED YES, HE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME WELL, AS TIME WENT BY, JOHNNY KEPT RIGHT ON PLANTING HIS APPLE TREES. AND MAKING FRIENDS EVERYWHERE. AND HIS BEST FRIENDS WAS THE PIONEERS. FOR OF COURSE, JOHN WAS PLANTING MORE THAN AN APPLE TREE. HE WAS PLANTING HIS OWN BOUNDLESS FAITH AND COURAGE, TOO. AND THAT GIVE FOLKS NEW HEART. NEW HOPE IN THE JOB THEY HAD TO DO. AND AS MORE AND MORE PIONEERS COME TO PUSH BACK THE FOREST, THE KINDLY DEEDS OF LITTLE JOHNNY APPLESEED SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE LAND. AND MORE THAN ONCE, WITH A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED JUBILEE, FOLKS WOULD HONOR JOHNNY APPLESEED. AND THE FRUIT OF THE APPLE TREE. COME RIGHT OUT TO THE RIGHT OF THE RING INSIDE ARCH AND OUTSIDE UNDER IT AIN'T GONNA RAIN WITHOUT NO THUNDER FIRST AND THIRD, BALANCE, SWING COME RIGHT OUT TO THE RIGHT OF THE RING BUCKLE UP FOUR WITH EIGHT HANDS ROUND I'LL SWING YOURS, YOU SWING MINE I'LL SWING MY GIRL, HALF THE TIME [FIDDLE MUSIC] WHEN YOU'RE STRAIGHT TO A DO-SI-DO CHICKEN IN THE BREAD PAN KICKIN' OUT DOUGH BIG PIG ROOTIN' UP A LITTLE TATER ROW ONE MORE CHANGE AND HOME YOU GO NOW SOMETIMES, IF JOHN WAS A-PASSIN' BY, HE'D MOSY OVER AND KIND OF LOOK IN ON THE DOINGS.

HE KNOWED A MAN CAN'T TAKE NO REST, IF HE AIMS TO PLANT THE WHOLE DARN WILDERNESS IN APPLE TREES. AND SO IT WAS, FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS, JOHN WALKED AND PLANTED THAT OLD FRONTIER. YES, SIR. 40 YEARS OF WALKING AND PLANTING. AND IN THAT SPACE OF TWO SCORE YEARS, THIS LITTLE MAN... HE THROWED HIS SHADOW CLEAR ACROSS THE LAND. ACROSS 100,000 MILES SQUARE. AND IN THAT SHADOW EVERYWHERE, YOU'LL FIND HE LEFT HIS BLESSINGS THREE. LOVE AND FAITH AND THE APPLE TREE BOY, FOR SLEEPING, YOU TAKE THE CAKE. COME ON, GET UP!

THEN A MUSIC MASTER WOVE AROUND IT MELODY. AN ARTIST TOUCHED IT. GAVE IT FORM IN COLORS RICH AND WARM. NOW WE BRING TO YOU THESE THREE: POEM, PICTURE, MELODY. A SIMPLE TRIBUTE TO A TREE. I THINK THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE A POEM LOVELY AS A TREE A TREE WHOSE HUNGRY MOUTH IS PRESSED AGAINST THE EARTH'S SWEET FLOWING BREAST A TREE THAT LOOKS AT GOD ALL DAY AND LIFTS HER LEAFY ARMS TO PRAY A TREE THAT MAY IN SUMMER WEAR A NEST OF ROBINS IN HER HAIR UPON WHOSE BOSOM SNOW HAS LAIN WHO INTIMATELY LIVES WITH RAIN POEMS ARE MADE BY FOOLS LIKE ME BUT ONLY GOD CAN MAKE A TREE TO THE INTOXICATING RHYTHM OF THE SAMBA, A TALENTED MISS SERVES UP A MUSICAL COCKTAIL WITH A TRUE LATIN AMERICAN FLAVOR. SO, IF THREE BOISTEROUS BIRDS OF A FEATHER FALL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS TORRID TROPICAL TEMPO, DON'T BLAME THEM. BLAME IT ON THE RHYTHM OF THE SAMBA. IF YOUR SPIRITS HAVE HIT A NEW LOW AND THEY LONG TO HIT A NEW HIGH ONE LITTLE MUSICAL COCKTAIL WILL LIFT THEM TO THE SKY MIX A JIGGER OF RHYTHM WITH A STRAIN OF A FEW GUITARS ADD A DASH OF THE SAMBA AND A FEW MELODIOUS BARS AND THEN, AND THEN YOU TAKE A SMALL CABAÇA [SHAKING] ONE PANDEIRO TAKE A CUÍCA YOU'VE GOT THE FASCINATING RHYTHM OF THE SAMBA IF GUITARS ARE STRUMMING BIRDS ARE HUMMING DRUMS ARE DRUMMING THEN YOU CAN BLAME IT ON THE RHYTHM OF THE SAMBA FOR THERE IS SOMETHING 'BOUT THE BEAT YOU CLING TO THAT'S THE TYPE OF SONG YOU SING TO BUT THE KIND OF THING YOU SWING TO WHEN YOU GET TO BOUNCING WITH THE BEAT IN YOUR FEET FOR WHEN YOU'RE BOUNCING TO THE BEAT YOU'RE REELING WITH THE CARIOCA FEELING BUT IF YOU WANT TO HIT THE CEILING HERE IS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO YOU TAKE A SMALL CABAÇA ONE PANDEIRO TAKE A CUÍCA YOU GOT THE FASCINATING RHYTHM OF THE SAMBA [SHAKING] [ORGAN PLAYS] [BIRD LAUGHING] [DRUMS PLAYING] [SINGING] [SINGING CONTINUES] [LAUGHING] HERE'S A TALL TALE STRAIGHT FROM THE CHUCK WAGON. JUST THE WAY THE OLD-TIMERS USED TO TELL IT. ACCORDING TO THEM, PECOS BILL WAS THE ROUGHEST, TOUGHEST, ROOTENEST, TOOTENEST, SHOOTENEST COWPOKE THAT EVER LIVED. WELL, ANY STORY ABOUT OLD PECOS IS BOUND TO BE RIGHT STRONG MEDICINE, SO... MAYBE IT'S BEST TO SASHAY INTO IT KINDA GENTLE LIKE. SHADES OF NIGHT ARE FALLIN' AS THE WIND BEGINS TO SIGH AND THE WORLD IS SILHOUETTED 'GAINST THE SKY [WHISTLING] BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL BLUE MOON SHINING THROUGH THE TREES AND THE PLAINTIVE WAIL FROM THE DISTANCE [COYOTES HOWLING] COMES A DRIFTIN' ON THE EVENING BREEZE MOVE ALONG BLUE SHADOWS MOVE ALONG SOON THE DAWN WILL COME AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY BUT UNTIL THE DARKNESS SHEDS ITS VEIL THERE'LL BE BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL MOVE ALONG MOVE ALONG, BLUE SHADOWS MOVE ALONG MOVE ALONG, MOVE ALONG, MOVE ALONG SOON THE DAWN WILL COME AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY ON YOUR WAY BUT UNTIL THE DARKNESS SHEDS ITS VEIL THERE'LL BE BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL [HOWLING] UNCLE ROY?

COWBOYS IN IT? YES, SIREE. INDIANS TOO? I COULD THROW IN MAYBE TWO OR THREE, BUT MOSTLY THIS STORY'S ABOUT PECOS BILL. PECOS BILL? WHO'S HE? [GUITAR STOPS] WHAT? NEVER HEARD OF PECOS BILL? IMAGINE THAT! I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNOWED PECOS. BOBBY, I'M SURPRISED AT YOU. BILL WAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST BUCKAROO. HE WAS THE ROUGHEST, TOUGHEST CRITTER NEVER KNOWN TO BE A QUITTER 'CAUSE HE NEVER HAD NO FEAR FOR MAN OR BEAST YEP, THAT THERE PECOS BILL WAS... [NEIGHING] EASY, TRIGGER. I'M NOT FORGETTING BILL'S HORSE. SHUCKS, I COULDN'T FORGET WIDOW MAKER. WIDOW MAKER? THAT'S A FUNNY NAME. THAT HORSE EARNED IT, JUST THE SAME. HE WAS A KILLER. DYNAMITE ON THE HOOF. WIDOW MAKER WAS BILL'S BEST PAL. UNTIL ALONG CAME THAT BEAUTIFUL PRAIRIE GAL. [WHINNYING] SHUCKS, A WOMAN IN THE STORY. BUT WHAT A WOMAN! SHE WAS FRESH AS THE DEW ON A PRAIRIE ROSE A TRUE THOROUGHBRED FROM HER HEAD TO HER TOES THAT THERE WAS SLUE FOOT SUE SWEET SUE SLUE FOOT SUE, HUH! I'D RATHER HEAR ABOUT THE COYOTES. UNCLE ROY, YOU STARTED TO SAY... WHY THE COYOTES HOWL AT THE MOON THAT WAY? YOU'RE RIGHT, HONEY, BUT IT ALL FITS TOGETHER. CAN'T TELL ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. BECAUSE THE STORY OF BILL AND THAT SLUE FOOT GAL IS A STORY OF COYOTES AND WHY THEY HOWL. I'M GETTING DOWN TO THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW. [ROY] NOW, HERE ON THE MAP OF THE OLD U.S., COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY WILDERNESS, LIES TEXAS. [COWBOY] AMEN. [ROY] THERE'S SOME OTHER STATES SCATTERED AROUND. [COWBOY] LIKE WYOMING. MILWAUKEE.

[COWBOY] THAT THERE IS THE PECOS RIVER. SHE WAS PURE ALKALI. JUST NATURALLY MEAN WATER. WHY, THE BUZZARDS WON'T EVEN TOUCH IT. [WHISTLING] INTO THIS FERTILE GARDEN SPOT, ONCE THERE COME A PRAIRIE CART. THERE WAS MA AND PA AND 16 BRATS. FOUR HOUND DOGS. AND A COUPLE OF CATS. ALL GOING WEST, LOOKING FOR ELBOW ROOM. SURE COULD USE SOME OF THE SAME. CROSSING THE PECOS RIVERBED, SOMETHING FELL OUT AND LIT ON HIS HEAD. FOLKS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS GONE. OL' WAGON JUST KEPT ROLLING ALONG. YEP, IT WAS BILL. POOR LITTLE CRITTER. HOMELESS AS A POKER CHIP. ALONG CAME NIGHT AND A PRAIRIE MOON OL' MA COYOTE HURRYIN' HOME SHE WAS DUE FOR A SHOCK AT HER JOURNEY'S END FOR THE STORK HAD DELIVERED A DIVIDEND PLUM UNUSUAL! YEP! IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

MA'S OL' HEART JUST PLUM CAVED IN BILL SEEN RIGHT OFF THAT HE NEEDN'T FEAR HE'D STAKED HIMSELF A CLAIM RIGHT HERE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THAT OL' CHUCKWAGON. YEP, OL' BILL WAS HUNGRIER THAN A WOODPECKER WITH A HEADACHE. SO, WHAT FOLLOWED AS A NATURAL FACT, THAT BILL GROWED UP WITH THAT COYOTE PACK. HE SOON BECOME THE MAIN TOP HAND. IN A WAY THEY ALL COULD UNDERSTAND. BUT LITTLE BILL, HE COULDN'T REST, TILL HE PROVED HIMSELF THE A-1 BEST. SO, HE STUDIED THE OTHER VARMINTS TOO. THEN, SHOWED 'EM ALL A TRICK OR TWO. OUTLOPED THE ANTELOPE. OUTJUMPED THE JACK RABBIT. YEAH, BILL EVEN OUTHISSED THE RATTLESNAKE. THEN ONE DAY CROSS THE BURNIN' SAND A STRANGER COME TO THE PECOS LAND THE USUAL COMMITTEE WAS THERE TODAY TO WELCOME THEIR GUEST IN THE USUAL WAY NOW, 50 TO 1 WEREN'T NO FAIR FIGHT. BUT 1 PLUS BILL MADE IT JUST ABOUT RIGHT. WELL, IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP. FROM THAT TIME ON, THEM TWO STUCK TOGETHER. LIKE WARTS ON A TOAD, LIKE BIRDS OF A FEATHER. WHEN BILL GROWED UP, IT WAS NATURAL OF COURSE, HE'D CHOOSE A CAREER TO SUIT HIM AND HIS HORSE. YEP, BILL BECOME A ROOTIN', TOOTIN' COWBOY! PECOS BILL WAS QUITE A COWBOY DOWN IN TEXAS AND THE WESTERN SUPERMAN TO SAY THE LEAST HE WAS THE ROUGHEST, TOUGHEST CRITTER NEVER KNOWN TO BE A QUITTER 'CAUSE HE NEVER HAD NO FEAR OF MAN OR BEAST SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY YI-YAY YIPPEE YI-YO FOR THE TOUGHEST CRITTER WEST OF THE ALAMO ONCE HE ROPED A RAGING CYCLONE OUT OF NOWHERE THEN HE STRADDLED IT AND SETTLED DOWN WITH EASE AND WHILE THAT CYCLONE BUCKED AND FLITTED PECOS ROLLED A SMOKE AND LIT IT AND HE TAMED THAT ORNERY WIND DOWN TO A BREEZE SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY YIPPEE YI-YO [YODELING] ONCE THERE WAS A DROUGHT THAT SPREAD ALL OVER TEXAS SO, TO SUNNY CALIFORNY HE DID GO AND THOUGH THE GAG IS KINDA CORNY HE BROUGHT RAIN FROM CALIFORNY THAT'S THE WAY WE GOT THE GULF OF MEXICO SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY YI-YAY YIPPEE YI-YO FOR THE TOUGHEST CRITTER WEST OF THE ALAMO [MOOING] ONCE A BAND OF RUSTLERS STOLE A HERD OF CATTLE BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE HERD THEY STOLE WAS BILL'S AND WHEN HE CAUGHT THEM CROOKED VILLAINS PECOS KNOCKED OUT ALL THEIR FILLINGS THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S GOLD IN THEM THAR HILLS SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY YI-YAY YIPPEE YI-YO FOR THE TOUGHEST CRITTER WEST OF THE ALAMO OHHH PECOS LOST HIS WAY WHILE TRAVELING ON THE DESERT WATER IT WAS 90 MILES ACROSS THE BURNIN' SAND WATER HE KNEW HE'D NEVER REACH THE BORDER WATER IF HE DIDN'T GET SOME WATER WATER SO, HE GOT A STICK AND DUG THE RIO GRANDE [COWBOYS SINGING] WHILE A TRIBE OF PAINTED INDIANS DID A WAR DANCE PECOS STARTED SHOOTIN' UP THEIR LITTLE GAME HE GAVE THEM REDSKINS SUCH A SHAKEUP THAT THEY JUMPED OUT OF THEIR MAKE-UP THAT'S THE WAY THE PAINTED DESERT GOT ITS NAME SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY FOR THE TOUGHEST CRITTER WEST OF THE ALAMO WHILE RECLININ' ON A CLOUD HIGH OVER TEXAS WITH HIS GUN HE MADE THE STARS EVAPORATE THEN PECOS SAW THE STARS DECLININ' SO HE LEFT ONE BRIGHTLY SHININ' AS THE EMBLEM OF THE LONE STAR TEXAS STATE SO, YIPPEE YI-YAY YI-YAY YIPPEE YI-YO YEP, THEM WAS HAPPY DAYS FOR BILL AND THAT HORSE. LOOKED LIKE NOTHING COULD EVER COME BETWEEN 'EM. THEN IT HAPPENED. NOW BILL WAS HAPPY THAT FATEFUL DAY. KILLIN' SOME TIME IN HIS CAREFREE WAY. INVENTIN' A ONE-MAN RODEO. A-BUTTIN' HEADS WITH THE BUFFALO. POOR BILL. HAPPY AS A HOG IN A TURNIP PATCH. AND THEN... OL' MAN FATE STARTED DEALIN' FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK. FOR DOWN THE STREAM COME SLUE FOOT SUE, WITH ALL HER CHARMS REVEALED TO VIEW. LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING FROM OUT IN A DREAM. FIRST FEMALE WOMAN BILL'S EVER SEEN. [WOLF WHISTLE] SHE WAS STRANGE. UNUSUAL! YEAH, BUT POWERFUL STIMULATING. LIKE A SLUG OF RYE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. GAVE HIM A RIGHT PECULIAR FEELING, SET HIS SENSES PLUM TO REELIN'. WITH A POUNDING SOUND INSIDE HIS EARS, LIKE THE GALLOPING HOOVES OF A THOUSAND STEERS. INSIDE HIS CHEST WAS A-SEETHIN' AND A-CHURNIN', HIS BLOOD WAS BOILIN', HIS BRAIN WAS BURNIN'. BURNIN' WITH A FIRE THAT COULD ONLY BE COOLED... IN THE BECKONING DEPTHS OF TWO BLUE LIMPID POOLS YEP. L'AMOUR HAD COME TO PECOS BILL. [WHOOPING] WIDOW MAKER WAS PLUM PUZZLED. LOOKED LIKE TROUBLE TO HIM. AND HE SURE WAS RIGHT. BILL WAS BUSY INVENTING COURTIN', WESTERN-STYLE. HE ARRANGED FOR THE MOON TO RISE JUST RIGHT AND FLOOD THE LAND WITH A SILVERY LIGHT ORDERED THE STARS IN HEAVEN ABOVE TO FORM A TOKEN OF UNDYING LOVE THEN CROSS THE SKY IN WORDS OF FIRE BILL TOLD SWEET SUE OF HIS OWN HEART'S DESIRE SWEET SUE I LOVE YOU SO, SUE NAMED THE WEDDING DAY. BUT THERE WAS A PRICE BILL HAD TO PAY. SUE WANTED A BUSTLE, THE FINEST OF COURSE. SHE AIMED TO BE WEDDED RIDING BILL'S HORSE. SUE GOT HER BUSTLE AND IT SURE WAS CLASSY. PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH ON THAT SWEET GAL'S CHASSIS. THAT THERE HAPPY BLUSHING BRIDE WAS BUSTING OUT WITH GIRLISH PRIDE. [WOLF WHISTLES] BUT BILL HAD PROMISED SUE A RIDE ON WIDOW MAKER TOO. WOULD THAT HORSE BE WILLING TO LET SUE RIDE? HERE COMES THE ANSWER, FIT TO BE TIED. WIDOW MAKER WAS PLUM IRRITATED. BUT THAT DIDN'T BOTHER SUE NONE. SHE WALKED RIGHT UP TO THAT CRITTER'S SIDE. HER GENTLE HAND TOUCHED HIS BRISTLIN' HIDE. HER FOOT FOUND THE STIRRUP WITH THE FLICK OF HER BUSTLE. SUE WAS ABOARD, AND SAT FOR THE TUSSLE. THE PROCEEDINGS BEGUN TO COMMENCE. FORTHWITH. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THAT THERE SUE WAS A REGULAR FEMALE BUCKAROO. AND THEN, THAT BUSTLE. UNDERNEATH THEM FRILLS AND FLOUNCES, SUE WAS DEVELOPIN' PLENTY OF BOUNCES. GOT TO BE MORE THAN THAT GAL COULD HANDLE. AND SUE TOOK OFF LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE. THAT DEVILISH CONTRAPTION OF STEEL AND WIRE, KEPT BOUNCING THAT POOR GAL HIGHER AND HIGHER. AND SOON IT WAS PLAIN TO THE MULTITUDE THAT SUE WAS GAININ' ALTITUDE. SURE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS A GONER. BUT NO, HERE COME A RAY OF HOPE. LOOK, IT WERE BILL AND HIS TRUSTY ROPE. HE DONE SOON PUT A STOP TO THIS. SHUCKS, BILL WAS NEVER KNOWED TO MISS. BILL WAS CALM, CONFIDENT. HE BUILT HIS LOOP WITH CARELESS EASE. HE JUDGED HIS DISTANCE, TESTED THE BREEZE. THEN A WHIRL AND A TWIRL AND A TWIST OF THE WRIST. HE LET HER GO. BUT THE CHAMPION MISSED. HOW IT COME TO HAPPEN, NOBODY COULD EVER FIGURE OUT. SHE WAS OFF AGAIN ON HER HEAVENLY FLIGHT. UP, UP SHE WENT CLEAN OUT OF SIGHT. TILL FAR INTO SPACE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAID FINALLY COME TO THE MOON. AND THAT'S WHERE SHE STAYED. IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, USA, LIFE STILL GOES ON IN THE SAME OLD WAY. AND THE PECOS RIVER STILL FLOWS ON, BUT THE GREATEST COWBOY ON EARTH IS GONE. YEAH, BILL WENT BACK TO THE COYOTES. BUT HE NEVER FORGOT SUE. AND EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE MOON ROSE HIGH, HE'D LIFT HIS VOICE IN MOURNFUL CRY. BEWAILING THE FATE OF HIS LADY FAIR, HIS LONG LOST LOVE IN THE SKY UP THERE. SO PAINFUL WAS HIS GRIEF TO SEE, THE VARMINTS JOINED IN OUT OF SYMPATHY. AND THAT'S HOW COME, TO THIS VERY DAY, COYOTES HOWL AT THE MOON THAT WAY. MOVE ALONG MOVE ALONG, BLUE SHADOWS MOVE ALONG MOVE ALONG, MOVE ALONG, MOVE ALONG SOON THE DAWN WILL COME AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY ON YOUR WAY BUT UNTIL THE DARKNESS SHEDS ITS VEIL THERE'LL BE BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL [HOWLING] Please rate this subtitle at www.osdb.link/76dc8
