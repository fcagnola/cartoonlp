## Abstract

This study will explore the changes and evolution in the language of Disney Pictures movies over time through the computational lenses of topic modelling and sentiment analysis. An initial round of clustering offers insight into prevalent topics and allows us to understand how movies are thematically grouped together. Then, if warranted, additional analyses within clusters offer insights into differences between male and female leads, how tale-related language evolves over time and how this kind of motion picture deals with themes such as adventure, future and technology.
